migrate_vbrief.py -- Migrate a Deft project to the vBRIEF-centric document model.

Converts existing SPECIFICATION.md + specification.vbrief.json + PROJECT.md +
ROADMAP.md into the new lifecycle folder structure defined by RFC #309.

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/migrate_vbrief.py [project_root]

Exit codes:
    0 -- migration completed successfully
    1 -- migration failed (errors printed to stderr)
