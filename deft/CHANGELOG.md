## [Unreleased]

## [0.14.1] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- **ROADMAP.md em-dash migration for Windows compatibility** (#237, t1.11.6): Replaced all 317 Unicode em-dash characters (U+2014) with ASCII `--` in ROADMAP.md phase bodies, Completed section, Open Issues Index rows, and changelog notes -- enables `edit_files` tool on Windows without PowerShell fallback (warpdotdev/warp#9022)
- **Blocker carve-out for main.md instant-fix drift rule** (#241, t1.11.7): Added carve-out to `main.md` Decision Making instant-fix `⊗` rule -- hard blockers (current task literally cannot complete without the fix) are now permitted in-scope with mandatory GitHub issue filing; non-blocking nice-to-fix, quality improvements, and adjacent issues remain prohibited

### Added
- **Skill completion gates and pre-commit file review** (#238, #239, #243; t1.11.3, t1.11.4, t1.11.5): Added batch CHANGELOG convention to `skills/deft-roadmap-refresh/SKILL.md` -- one entry at session end, not per-issue; added mandatory pre-commit file review step (encoding, duplication, structural checks) to roadmap-refresh Phase 4 pre-flight and `skills/deft-build/SKILL.md`; added Skill Completion Gate rule to `AGENTS.md` requiring explicit exit confirmation and chaining instructions; added EXIT block to roadmap-refresh Phase 4; added chaining annotations to AGENTS.md Skill Routing table (swarm chains to review-cycle, roadmap-refresh chains to review-cycle)
- **PS 5.1 Get-Content -Raw footgun and BOM-safe round-trip rules** (#236, t1.11.1): Added two `!` rules to `scm/github.md` PS 5.1 section -- use `Get-Content -Raw` to read files as a single string (avoids line-by-line BOM injection and Unicode mangling), and use `[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText` with the BOM-free UTF8 constructor for safe writes (PS 5.1 `Set-Content` and `Out-File` both inject a BOM even with `-Encoding UTF8`; `Out-File -Encoding utf8NoBOM` requires PS 7+); rationale paragraph documenting PS 5.1's UTF-16LE/UTF-8-with-BOM defaults
- **Warp terminal multi-line PS string temp-file rule** (#240, t1.11.2): Added `!` rule to `scm/github.md` new Warp Terminal Multi-Line String Handling subsection -- never paste multi-line PS here-strings into Warp agent input (Warp splits across command blocks); always write to a temp file first; corresponding lesson entry in `meta/lessons.md` documenting root cause and fix

### Changed
- **Roadmap Refresh (2026-04-09)**: Triaged 5 issues -- #221 (deft-roadmap-refresh explicit row format template, Phase 2), #226 (deft-rwldl rename + auto-suggestion triggers, Phase 2), #233 (More Determinism full initiative, Phase 5), #234 (README artifacts section, Phase 2); filed #235 as Phase 3 split-off from #233 (toolchain:check + changelog:check); filed #236/#237/#238/#239/#240/#241 to Phase 1 (#236: Get-Content -Raw UTF-8 footgun; #237: ROADMAP.md em-dash migration; #238: roadmap-refresh batch changelog; #239: mandatory pre-commit file review; #240: multi-line PS string Warp block splitting; #241: main.md blocker carve-out for instant-fix rule; #243: skill completion gate for chaining instructions); analysis comments posted

## [0.14.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **meta/philosophy.md -- deterministic > probabilistic design principle** (#159, t2.7.7): Created `meta/philosophy.md` documenting the "prefer deterministic components for repeatable actions" design principle -- definition, rationale, examples (Taskfile tasks, spec_validate.py, CI workflows), and scope note deferring broad application to Phase 5; referenced from `contracts/hierarchy.md` See also banner
- **strategies/bdd.md -- BDD/acceptance-test-first strategy** (#81, t2.7.8): Created `strategies/bdd.md` with RFC2119 legend and See also banner -- 6-step workflow (scenarios, failing tests, surface ambiguity, lock decisions, generate spec, chain into sizing gate), output artifacts (`specs/{feature}/acceptance-tests/` + `{feature}-bdd-context.md`), chaining gate integration as preparatory strategy, anti-patterns; added to `strategies/README.md`; added `test_bdd_strategy_exists` to `tests/content/test_structure.py`
- **deft-roadmap-refresh: analysis comment transparency** (#168, t2.7.1): Added `!` rule to Phase 2 Step 4 requiring agent to confirm to the user that an analysis comment was posted -- includes issue number and direct link to the comment
- **deft-roadmap-refresh: Phase 4 -- PR & Review Cycle** (#174, t2.7.2): Added Phase 4 after Phase 3 Cleanup -- asks user confirmation, runs pre-flight checks (CHANGELOG, task check, PR template) before pushing, commits/pushes/creates PR, then automatically sequences into `skills/deft-review-cycle/SKILL.md`
- **deft-roadmap-refresh: explicit cleanup convention** (#196, t2.7.3): Replaced ambiguous Phase 3 cleanup instruction with explicit rules -- remove entries from phase body entirely (Completed section is sole record), strike through in Open Issues Index with 'completed -- YYYY-MM-DD', added anti-pattern against duplicate records
- **skills/deft-sync/SKILL.md -- session-start framework sync skill** (#146, t2.7.5): Created `skills/deft-sync/SKILL.md` with RFC2119 legend and frontmatter -- 4-phase workflow (pre-flight dirty check, submodule update, project sync with vBRIEF validation + AGENTS.md freshness + new skills listing, summary with commit prompt); anti-patterns prohibit auto-commit, vbrief file overwrites, skipping dirty check, and upstream schema fetch; `.agents/skills/deft-sync/SKILL.md` thin pointer for auto-discovery; AGENTS.md Returning Sessions section and Skill Routing table updated
- **Deft alignment confirmation rule** (#134, t2.7.6): Added behavioral rule to AGENTS.md requiring agents to confirm "Deft Directive active -- AGENTS.md loaded" at the start of each interactive session; covers context reset recovery (re-confirm after context window shifts); anti-pattern for starting without confirmation; true UI indicator deferred to Phase 5
- **GitHub Actions CI workflow** (#57, t3.1.1): Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with two jobs -- Python (ruff lint, mypy type-check on tests/, pytest with coverage) and Go (go test + cross-compile builds for linux/amd64, darwin/arm64, windows/amd64); triggers on pull_request and push to master; uses actions/checkout@v4, actions/setup-python@v5, actions/setup-go@v5, astral-sh/setup-uv@v5
- **Run CLI coverage tracking issue** (#228, t3.1.2): Opened GitHub issue "Bring run CLI into test coverage measurement" documenting why `run` and `run.py` are excluded from coverage (terminal-only CLI, needs refactor before coverage is meaningful); labeled Phase 4 backlog

### Changed
- **deft-review-cycle tiered review monitoring** (#195, t2.7.4): Replaced blocking `Start-Sleep`/`time.sleep()` shell polling in `skills/deft-review-cycle/SKILL.md` Step 4 with tiered monitoring -- Approach 1 (preferred): spawn sub-agent via `start_agent` to poll autonomously while main conversation stays interactive; Approach 2 (fallback): discrete `run_shell_command` (wait mode) calls with yield between checks; capability detection reuses `start_agent` tool-presence pattern from #188; existing exit conditions preserved; added 7 tests covering tiered monitoring section, both approaches, capability detection, and blocking sleep prohibition
- **Coverage threshold raised to 85%** (#57, t3.1.3): Updated `pyproject.toml` `fail_under` from 75 to 85; added inline comments to `[tool.coverage.run]` omit entries explaining why `run` and `run.py` are excluded (references #228)

## [0.13.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- **scm/github.md rewrite -- gh CLI rules, PR conventions, Windows encoding guidance** (#197, absorbs #201, t2.6.6): Rewrote `scm/github.md` with standing `gh` CLI rules (`--body-file` for multi-line bodies, immediate post-create verification), PR workflow conventions (squash-merge default, single-purpose branches, branch lifecycle, closing keywords), Windows/PowerShell 5.x encoding guidance (UTF-8 without BOM, avoid piping through PS 5.x redirection), and post-merge issue verification section
- **ASCII convention for machine-editable sections** (#202, t2.6.7): Added Windows/ASCII Conventions section to `scm/github.md` -- prefer `--` over em-dash, `->` over arrows, avoid emoji in body text for ROADMAP.md phase bodies, CHANGELOG.md entries, and Open Issues Index rows; `!` rule against Unicode em-dashes, curly quotes, and non-ASCII arrows in these sections; rationale references warpdotdev/warp#9022
- **skills/deft-rwldl/SKILL.md -- iterative pre-PR quality loop** (#182, t2.6.8): Created `skills/deft-rwldl/SKILL.md` with RFC2119 legend and frontmatter -- structured self-review loop (Read-Write-Lint-Diff-Loop) agents run before pushing a branch for PR creation; 5 phases with exit condition (full cycle with zero changes); anti-patterns section; `.agents/skills/deft-rwldl/SKILL.md` thin pointer for auto-discovery
- **Swarm release decision checkpoint** (#218, t1.10.2): Added tentative version bump suggestion to `skills/deft-swarm/SKILL.md` Phase 0 Step 3 analysis summary -- agent surfaces current version and proposes next version (patch/minor/major) based on scope; added Phase 5->6 confirmation gate requiring user approval of version bump and release scope before merge cascade begins; added anti-pattern prohibiting merge cascade without version bump proposal and user approval
- **Greptile rebase re-review latency guidance** (#207, t1.10.3): Documented in `skills/deft-swarm/SKILL.md` Phase 6 that force-pushing a rebased branch triggers a full Greptile re-review (~2-5 min per PR), not an incremental diff; added rebase-only annotation guidance (MAY note in PR comment); updated merge cascade warning with Greptile re-review time cost; recorded finding in `meta/lessons.md`
- **Instant-fix drift and skill-context bleed rules** (#198, t1.10.4): Added `⊗` rules to `main.md` Decision Making prohibiting mid-task instant fixes (must file issue instead) and skill-context bleed (must stop at skill boundary); added `!` exit-condition rule; companion `meta/lessons.md` entries (xrefs #159, #167, #184)
- **Mandatory skills/ scan rule** (#200, t1.10.5): Added `!` rule and `⊗` anti-pattern to `AGENTS.md` requiring agents to scan `skills/` before designing multi-step workflows; companion `meta/lessons.md` entry
- **Keyword-to-skill routing table** (#147, t2.6.4): Added Skill Routing section to `AGENTS.md` mapping trigger keywords to skill paths; added 3 missing skills (deft-review-cycle, deft-roadmap-refresh, deft-swarm) to `README.md` Skills section
- **README stale content fixes** (#219, t2.6.5): Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `contracts/hierarchy.md` to README directory tree; updated skills/ subtree to list all 5 skills; added hierarchy.md to Contracts section

### Fixed
- **pyproject.toml dev deps break task check in fresh worktrees** (#217, t1.10.1): Moved dev dependencies from `[project.optional-dependencies]` to `[dependency-groups]` (PEP 735); `uv sync` now installs dev deps by default in fresh worktrees without needing `--extra dev`; regenerated `uv.lock`; updated `languages/python.md` template to show `[dependency-groups]` pattern

### Changed
- **Roadmap Refresh (2026-04-07)**: Triaged 5 new issues — #217 (pyproject.toml dev deps breaks task check in fresh worktrees, Phase 1 Adoption Blockers), #218 (deft-swarm release decision checkpoint, Phase 1 Adoption Blockers), #207 (Greptile re-review latency on swarm merge cascade, Phase 2), #219 (README.md stale content, Phase 2), #212 (process control in Directive discussion, Phase 5); cleanup: struck through #184/#188/#191/#192/#199 in index (completed v0.12.0), removed duplicate bare #198 entry, added #182 description; analysis comments posted on all 5 issues

## [0.12.1] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **State WHY rule for interview strategy** (#84, t2.2.3): Added `!` rule to `strategies/interview.md` Interview Rules requiring agents to state the underlying principle (1 sentence) when making an opinionated recommendation — part of "Deft as teacher" so users understand the contract hierarchy reasoning behind recommendations
- **CONTRIBUTING.md contributor bootstrap guide** (#67, t2.3.1): Created `CONTRIBUTING.md` at repo root with full contributor onboarding — prerequisites (Go 1.22+, Python 3.11+, uv, task), dev environment setup, running tests (`task test`, `task check`), running CLI locally (`uv run python run`), building the Go installer (`go build ./cmd/deft-install/`); documents `task check` as the authoritative pre-commit gate and defines a passing `task check` as the definition of ready-to-commit

### Fixed
- **PR merge hygiene -- squash-merge issue-close verification** (#167, t1.8.4): Root cause documented in `meta/lessons.md` -- GitHub squash merges can silently fail to process closing keywords (`Closes #N`) from PR bodies, leaving referenced issues open with no error; added closing keyword guidance and post-merge verification checklist to `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`; added Post-Merge Verification section to `skills/deft-review-cycle/SKILL.md` mirroring `deft-swarm` Phase 6 Step 2; added issue-close verification convention to `AGENTS.md` PR conventions; added anti-pattern for assuming squash merge auto-closed issues
- **Consistent ./deft/ installation path** (#116, t1.8.3): Installer now creates thin pointers for all 6 skills (deft, deft-setup, deft-build, deft-review-cycle, deft-roadmap-refresh, deft-swarm) instead of only 3 -- previously deft-review-cycle, deft-roadmap-refresh, and deft-swarm were missing from the installer's `.agents/skills/` setup, making them undiscoverable in installed projects; all thin pointers consistently use `deft/`-prefixed paths; added 3 path consistency tests verifying skill pointer `deft/` prefix, only expected files at project root, and DeftDir placement

## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Swarm close-out orchestration rules** (#206, t2.6.3): Added monitor-centric close-out rules to skills/deft-swarm/SKILL.md Phase 6 -- merge authority (monitor proposes, user approves), rebase cascade ownership (monitor owns), GIT_EDITOR=true for non-interactive rebase, post-merge issue verification step; added push autonomy carve-out for swarm agents; added MCP fallback note to skills/deft-review-cycle/SKILL.md (gh-only when MCP unavailable)
- **Deft-swarm runtime capability detection** (#188, t1.9.3): Replaced static Option A/B/C launch path selection in `skills/deft-swarm/SKILL.md` Phase 3 with runtime capability detection — agent probes for `start_agent` tool at runtime, uses it as preferred path if available (Warp orchestration), falls back to manual Warp tabs silently when unavailable but Warp detected, gates Warp-specific paths on `WARP_*` environment variables; cloud (`oz agent run-cloud`) preserved as explicit user-requested escape hatch only; anti-patterns updated for dynamic approach
- **Deft-swarm mandatory analyze phase** (#199, t1.9.4): Added Phase 0 — Analyze to `skills/deft-swarm/SKILL.md` before Phase 1 (Select) — reads ROADMAP.md and SPECIFICATION.md, surfaces blockers (blocked spec tasks, missing spec coverage, dependency conflicts), presents analysis summary to user, requires explicit user approval before proceeding to task selection; anti-pattern added prohibiting Phase 1 entry without Phase 0 completion

### Fixed
- **vBRIEF reference type schema vendor** (#133, t1.8.2): Vendored updated upstream vBRIEF schema — `VBriefReference.type` expanded from `{"enum": ["x-vbrief/plan"]}` to pattern-based `^x-vbrief/` accepting all `x-vbrief/*` reference types (e.g. `x-vbrief/plan`, `x-vbrief/context`, `x-vbrief/research`); unblocks generated vBRIEF files that use context/research references; task t1.8.2 moved from `[blocked]` to `[completed]`
- **deft-review-cycle autonomous polling** (#184, t1.9.4): Added `!` rule to Step 4 requiring agents to autonomously poll for Greptile review updates after pushing without stopping to ask the user; added `⊗` anti-pattern for pausing the review/fix loop for user confirmation; added candidate lesson to `meta/lessons.md` Review Cycle Monitoring section
- **deft-review-cycle proactive test coverage** (#192, t1.9.5): Added Step 3b (between fix commit and push) requiring agents to scan changed lines for untested code paths and write tests in the same batch; eliminates one CI round-trip per fix cycle; added `⊗` anti-pattern for pushing without coverage scan
- **Swarm force-push anti-pattern scope fix** (#209): Scoped blanket force-push anti-pattern to swarm agents only -- monitor may --force-with-lease after rebase cascade per Phase 6; fixed GIT_EDITOR portability (added Windows PowerShell fallback echo); added 7 regression tests for Phase 6, Push Autonomy, and MCP fallback content
- **vBRIEF reference-type workaround removal** (#191, t1.9.3): Verified no defensive workarounds remain in `vbrief/vbrief.md`, `templates/make-spec.md`, or `scripts/spec_validate.py` after upstream deftai/vBRIEF#2 resolution; spec task added and marked completed

### Changed
- **Roadmap Refresh (2026-04-06)**: Triaged 14 new issues, promoted 1, closed 2, cleaned 1 stale entry — #192 (proactive test coverage after review-fix commits, Phase 1 Adoption Blockers), #191 (remove vBRIEF defensive workarounds, deftai/vBRIEF#2 resolved, Phase 1 Adoption Blockers), #189 (closed as superseded by #191), #184 (deft-review-cycle autonomous polling imperative after push, Phase 1 Adoption Blockers), #188 (deft-swarm runtime `start_agent` capability detection + Warp environment gate, Phase 2; reshaped from static Option D label to tool-presence-based detection), #182 (deft-rwldl skill: iterative pre-PR quality loop, Phase 2), #194 (user-facing best practices guide, Phase 2), #195 (review monitor orchestration, Phase 2), #196 (roadmap-refresh cleanup convention, Phase 2), #197 (scm/github.md with gh CLI rules and Windows encoding guidance, Phase 2 -- absorbs #201), #198 (instant-fix drift and skill-context bleed rules for main.md, Phase 1), #199 (deft-swarm mandatory analyze phase, Phase 1), #200 (scan skills/ before improvising workflows, Phase 1), #202 (ASCII convention for machine-editable sections, Phase 2); promoted #188 from Phase 2 to Phase 1 (user actively testing swarm); closed #201 (absorbed by #197); moved #166 to Completed (closed on GitHub); cleaned up 2 stale entries (#133 closed 2026-04-05, #58 closed 2026-04-06); updated #147 title and scope (expanded to cover keyword routing + 3 missing skills); analysis comments posted on all issues

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **Change gate UX — replace name-echo with yes/no confirmation** (#185, t1.9.1):
  - `/deft:change` confirmation gate no longer requires users to retype the full change name; agents now present the change name and ask for explicit yes/no confirmation
  - Accepted responses: `yes`, `confirmed`, `approve`; vague responses (`proceed`, `do it`, `go ahead`) still rejected
  - Updated across all framework surfaces: `main.md` Decision Making rule, `skills/deft-build/SKILL.md` Change Lifecycle Gate, `skills/deft-review-cycle/SKILL.md` Phase 1 audit, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` checklist
  - Spec task t1.9.1 added to `vbrief/specification.vbrief.json` and rendered to `SPECIFICATION.md`
- **deft-swarm Option A limitations documented** (#179): Updated `skills/deft-swarm/SKILL.md` Phase 3 — demoted Option A (`oz agent run`) from preferred to "currently limited"; elevated Option B (interactive Warp tab) as recommended launch method; added known-limitations callout noting Option A does not receive global Warp Drive rules, MCP UUIDs, or auto-injected context; documented inline MCP JSON workaround; added two new anti-patterns; updated default launch from Option A to Option B; recorded finding in `meta/lessons.md`
- **AGENTS.md pre-implementation gate enforcement** (#186): Added `!` (MUST) markers to "Before code changes" checklist items in `AGENTS.md`; added `⊗` anti-pattern prohibiting file edits before spec coverage check and branch creation — even if user says "yes" or "proceed"; root cause: agent loaded AGENTS.md but treated pre-implementation checklist as advisory due to missing RFC2119 enforcement markers

## [0.10.3] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **vBRIEF schema conformance — agent generation guidance + validation** (#126, #144):
  - Fixed `speckit.md` Phase 4 Task Structure: replaced legacy flat format (`vbrief`, `tasks`, `do`, `todo/doing/done`) with correct vBRIEF v0.5 envelope (`vBRIEFInfo` + `plan` object, `title` field, `pending/running/completed` lifecycle)
  - Added hierarchical `subItems` guidance and examples to `vbrief/vbrief.md`, `skills/deft-setup/SKILL.md`, and `templates/make-spec.md` — agents now have explicit instructions for representing Phase → Subphase → Task nesting in vBRIEF JSON
  - Added narrative-must-be-string rules (`plan.narratives` and `PlanItem.narrative` values must be plain strings, never objects or arrays) across all generation docs
  - Strengthened `spec_validate.py`: recursive `subItems` validation (title, status, narrative types at all nesting levels), `plan.narratives` string enforcement, detection of `items` key misuse inside PlanItems (should be `subItems`)
  - Added 5 new tests: narrative object detection, item narrative array detection, `items`-inside-PlanItem detection, recursive subItems invalid status, valid hierarchical spec passthrough

### Changed
- **ROADMAP.md update convention** (#170): Changed PR conventions in `AGENTS.md` from "updates happen on merge" to "updates happen at release time — batch-move merged issues to Completed during the CHANGELOG promotion commit"; added Phase 6 Step 5 to `skills/deft-swarm/SKILL.md` codifying this as the release-time checkpoint; added ⊗ anti-pattern prohibiting ROADMAP.md edits during swarm close; added ⊗ to Phase 1 Step 2 excluding ROADMAP.md from swarm shared-file exceptions
- **Mermaid gist-rendering guidance**: Codified GitHub/Gist sequence-diagram readability rules in `languages/mermaid.md` as explicit RFC2119 MUST/SHOULD guidance: do not rely on `init.background`/`themeCSS` alone, use a grey participant-only `box ... end`, keep messages/notes outside the box, and keep sequence workarounds diagram-type-scoped; added regression tests in `tests/content/test_mermaid_guidance.py` (#102)
- **Specification sync**: Full sync of `vbrief/specification.vbrief.json` and rendered `SPECIFICATION.md` — corrected 15 stale task statuses (t1.1.1–t1.5.2, t1.6.1–t1.6.4, t2.1.2–t2.2.2, t2.5.1–t2.5.5 all now `completed`); added 9 missing tasks: retroactive coverage for completed work (t1.7.1 #166, t1.7.2 #171, t1.7.3 #175, t1.7.4 #172, t2.6.1 #104), new tasks for open Phase 1 issues (t1.8.1 #126/#144, t1.8.2 #133, t1.8.3 #116, t1.8.4 #167); reordered all tasks by phase (1→2→3); total 46 tasks (34 completed, 9 pending, 3 blocked)

## [0.10.2] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Branching preference in project setup**: `cmd_project` and `deft-setup` Phase 2 Track 1 now ask branching preference (branch-based — default/recommended, or trunk-based); emits `Allow direct commits to master: true` under `## Branching` in PROJECT.md if trunk-based is chosen (#171)

### Fixed
- **No direct-to-master agent commits**: Added `⊗` hard gate to `main.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `skills/deft-build/SKILL.md` — agents must always create a feature branch and open a PR; `Allow direct commits to master: true` in `PROJECT.md ## Branching` provides opt-in escape hatch for solo/trunk-based projects (#171)
- **Review cycle push discipline + polling cadence**: Added `⊗` rule to `skills/deft-review-cycle/SKILL.md` Step 4 prohibiting additional commits while Greptile is reviewing current head; added `~` `60s` minimum poll interval guidance; codified both as `meta/lessons.md` Review Cycle Monitoring lessons #2 and #3 (#175)

### Fixed
- **oz agent run correction**: Corrected `skills/deft-swarm/SKILL.md` Phase 3 — `oz agent run` is local (preferred automated launch path), `oz agent run-cloud` is the cloud path; rewrote options A/B/C, fixed prerequisites and anti-patterns; added correction addenda to `meta/lessons.md` lessons #1 and #7; updated `SPECIFICATION.md` t2.5.4 acceptance criteria (#172)

### Changed
- **Roadmap Refresh (2026-04-03)**: Triaged 5 new issues — #170 (move ROADMAP.md updates to release-time, Phase 2), #171 (hard gate against agent direct-to-master commits, Phase 1 Cleanup), #172 (deft-swarm skill oz agent run/run-cloud correction, Phase 1 Adoption Blockers — priority next), #174 (deft-roadmap-refresh review cycle chaining after PR push, Phase 2), #175 (deft-review-cycle no-push-during-review + polling cadence, Phase 1 Cleanup); analysis comments posted on all issues; meta/lessons.md updated with 3 new Windows/review-cycle encoding and monitoring lessons

### Added
- **Greptile integration guide**: Added tools/greptile.md — recommended Greptile dashboard and per-repo settings for teams using deft, covering triggerOnUpdates/statusCheck configuration, check runs vs. commit statuses distinction, troubleshooting, and anti-patterns (#166, t1.7.1)

- **Holzmann Power of Ten adaptation**: Added `coding/holzmann.md` — JPL/NASA Power of Ten rules (Holzmann, 2006) adapted for Deft with RFC 2119 notation; covers simple control flow, bounded loops, fixed resource allocation, small functions, runtime checks, minimal data scope, error/return checking, restricted metaprogramming/indirection, and maximum static checking (#104)
- **Superpowers adoption plan**: Added `docs/superpowers.md` — prioritized adoption plan identifying 8 patterns from [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) worth integrating into the Deft Directive (systematic debugging, verification gate, code review protocol, rationalization prevention, subagent dispatch, no-placeholders rule, git worktrees, branch completion)

## [0.10.1] - 2026-04-02

### Changed
- **README restructure**: Moved Getting Started section (install, setup, spec, build) from below the architecture/layers documentation to immediately after the TL;DR; added prominent installer download callout at the top of the page (#137, t2.5.3)
- **Language removed from USER.md**: Removed `**Primary Languages**` field from USER.md template and Phase 1 interview (Track 1 Step 2, Track 2 Step 2, Track 3 language inference) — language is a project-level concern determined per-project via codebase inference, not a user preference (#107, t1.1.3)
- **Deployment platform question**: Phase 2 Track 1 now asks deployment platform (cross-platform, Windows-native, macOS-native, Linux/Unix, embedded, web/cloud, mobile, other) before language — platform context drives a filtered language shortlist with progressive "Other" disclosure and missing-standards-file warning (#108, t1.1.4)

### Fixed
- **deft-review-cycle Greptile pre-flight**: Added Pre-Flight Check section to skills/deft-review-cycle/SKILL.md — verifies triggerOnUpdates is enabled before entering the review/fix loop, documents that Greptile posts check runs (Checks API) not commit statuses, adds @greptileai manual re-trigger fallback and anti-pattern for using wrong API endpoint (#166, t1.7.1)

- **Testing enforcement gate**: Added `!` hard gate rule to `main.md` Decision Making — no implementation is complete until tests written and `task check` passes; a general 'proceed' does not waive testing; added anti-pattern to `deft-build/SKILL.md` (#68, t1.6.1)
- **Change lifecycle gate enforcement**: Strengthened `/deft:change` rule in `main.md` — broad 'proceed'/'do it'/'go ahead' explicitly does NOT satisfy the gate; user must acknowledge the **named** change; added pre-flight gate to `deft-build/SKILL.md`, checklist item to `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, verification step to `deft-review-cycle/SKILL.md` Phase 1 audit; Phase 1 audit gaps now batched with Phase 2 fixes (#123, t1.6.2)
- **Context-aware branching for solo projects**: Added solo-project qualifier to `main.md` change lifecycle rule — `/deft:change` mandatory for team projects (2+ contributors), recommended for solo projects with quality gate as enforcement; mandatory regardless of team size for cross-cutting, architectural, or high-risk changes; full config-driven approach deferred to Phase 5 (#138, t1.6.3)
- **vBRIEF source step enforcement**: Added `⊗` rule to `main.md` vBRIEF Persistence — SPECIFICATION.md must never be written directly, must be generated from `specification.vbrief.json`; added anti-pattern to `deft-build/SKILL.md` (#139, t1.6.4)
- **deft-review-cycle Greptile signal**: Updated `skills/deft-review-cycle/SKILL.md` Step 4 to document that Greptile may advance its review by editing an existing PR issue comment rather than creating a new PR review object; added dual-surface detection guidance (issue comments as primary signal, PR review objects as secondary) with `updated_at` timestamp checking; added anti-pattern for relying solely on `pulls/{number}/reviews` (#145, t2.5.2)
- **Phase 2 inference boundary**: Added ⊗ rules to `deft-setup/SKILL.md` Phase 2 Inference section — MUST NOT scan `./deft/` for build files or run git commands inside `./deft/`; only inspect project root and non-deft subdirectories (#79, t1.1.1)
- **Phase 2 project name fallback**: Added fallback rule — when no build files exist at project root, default project name to current directory name and ask for confirmation (#80, t1.1.2)
- **AGENTS.md headless bypass**: Added headless/task-mode bypass to First Session gate so cloud agents, CI agents, and scheduled tasks skip interactive onboarding when dispatched with an explicit task (#142, t1.1.5)
- **CLI version display**: All `cmd_*` functions now print `Deft CLI v{VERSION}` on startup — previously `cmd_validate`, `cmd_doctor`, and `cmd_update` had no version display; existing headers normalized from `Deft v` to `Deft CLI v` (#49, t1.3.2)
- **CLI code quality sweep** (#118):
  - Removed stale `v0.3.7` from module docstring — VERSION constant (`0.4.2`) is the single source of truth
  - Removed `Requires: Python 3.6+` from docstring — conflicts with `run.bat` enforcing 3.13+; `run.bat` handles Windows version check independently
  - Changed bare `except:` in `cmd_spec` project-name parsing to `except (OSError, UnicodeDecodeError):` — no longer swallows `KeyboardInterrupt`/`SystemExit`
  - Documented `--force` flag in `usage()` help text for the `spec` command
  - Fixed `DEFT_PRD_PATH` env var misuse on Light sizing path — Light path now reads `DEFT_INTERVIEW_PATH` instead of overloading the PRD env var
- **Installer post-install text** (#131): Verified already fixed in v0.8.0 — `PrintNextSteps` says "Use AGENTS.md" (not "read agents.md")

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Review Cycle Skill**: Added `skills/deft-review-cycle/SKILL.md` — Greptile bot reviewer response workflow covering Phase 1 deft process audit, Phase 2 review/fix loop (batch fixes, wait-for-bot, exit condition), GitHub review submission rules, and anti-patterns; enables cloud agents to run autonomous PR review cycles; thin pointer added at `.agents/skills/deft-review-cycle/SKILL.md` (#135)
- **Roadmap Refresh Skill**: Added `skills/deft-roadmap-refresh/SKILL.md` — structured contributor workflow for triaging open issues into the phased roadmap (discovery, one-at-a-time analysis with human review, cleanup)
- **Roadmap Maintenance Strategy**: Added `strategies/roadmap.md` — optional user-facing guide for maintaining a living roadmap with agent-assisted triage
- **Agent Skill Pointer**: Added `.agents/skills/deft-roadmap-refresh/SKILL.md` thin pointer for auto-discovery
- **Swarm Skill**: Added `skills/deft-swarm/SKILL.md` — parallel local agent orchestration workflow with 6 phases (Select, Setup, Launch, Monitor, Review, Close), proven prompt template, file-overlap audit gate, monitoring checkpoints, takeover triggers, and anti-patterns; thin pointer at `.agents/skills/deft-swarm/SKILL.md` (#152)
- **history/changes/ README**: Added `history/changes/README.md` documenting the change lifecycle artifact structure — directory layout, lifecycle stages, and rules (#59, t2.1.2)
- **Contract hierarchy**: Created `contracts/hierarchy.md` documenting two hierarchy lenses — durability axis (Standards > APIs > Specs > Code) and generative axis (Spec → Contracts → Code); includes RFC2119 legend, examples, and anti-patterns (#84 Phase 1, t2.2.1)
- **Adaptive teaching behavior**: Added three adaptive teaching rules to `main.md` Agent Behavior section — be concise when accepted, explain reasoning when questioned, never lecture unprompted (#84 Phase 1, t2.2.2)

### Fixed
- **commands.md vBRIEF vocabulary**: Status lifecycle rule and example now use canonical vBRIEF v0.5 vocabulary — plan-level `draft`/`proposed`/`approved`, task-level `pending`/`running`/`completed`/`blocked`/`cancelled`; added missing `narrative` to task t3 in example; no use of legacy `todo`/`doing`/`done` (#25, t2.1.5)
- **core/project.md cleanup**: Replaced leaked personal project content with generic template; added legacy-location redirect note pointing to `./PROJECT.md` as the canonical path (t2.1.6)

### Changed
- **Yolo Strategy Deduplication**: Refactored `strategies/yolo.md` to reference `interview.md` for shared Light/Full path flows, SPECIFICATION guidelines, and Artifacts Summary — reduced from 165 to ~115 lines (#23)
- **Chaining Gate Cleanup**: Removed "Brownfield" alias from `interview.md` chaining gate options — now just "Map"
- **SpecKit Cross-Reference**: Added **⚠️ See also** banner to `strategies/speckit.md` (#24)
- **Strategies README**: Removed redundant `brownfield.md` row from strategy table; added roadmap strategy
- **README.md**: Updated directory tree and strategies reference list to reflect `default.md` deletion and `brownfield.md` redirect
- **Baseline Snapshot**: Regenerated `tests/content/snapshots/baseline.json` to reflect strategy file changes
- **Roadmap Refresh**: Triaged 12 new issues (#124, #126, #127, #131, #133–#140) into roadmap phases; moved #67, #91, #92 to Completed; cleaned stale index entries; filed upstream deftai/vBRIEF#2 for #133
- **Roadmap Refresh (2026-04-02)**: Triaged 5 new issues — #142 (AGENTS.md onboarding gate blocks headless/cloud agents, Phase 1), #144 (vBRIEF wrong narrative type + items/subItems, Phase 1 with #126), #145 (deft-review-cycle Greptile signal bug, Phase 1), #146 (deft-sync session-start skill, Phase 2), #147 (skills undocumented in README/AGENTS.md, Phase 2); fixed index formatting

### Removed
- **Redundant Strategy Files**: Deleted `strategies/default.md` (fully superseded by `interview.md`) and replaced `strategies/brownfield.md` with a redirect to `map.md` (#31, #50)

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Minimal CI Workflow**: Added .github/workflows/ci.yml — runs 	ask check (ruff, mypy, pytest) on all PRs and master pushes; gates merges until lint + tests pass (#57 partial)
- **Toolchain Validation Directive**: Added `coding/toolchain.md` with RFC2119 pre-implementation gate — MUST verify task runner, language compiler/runtime, and platform SDK (if applicable) before beginning implementation, stop and report if any are missing; pointer added to `coding/coding.md`; toolchain check added to `strategies/interview.md` Acceptance Gate and `skills/deft-build/SKILL.md` Step 2; iOS/Swift incident codified in `meta/lessons.md` (#106)
- **Build Output Validation Directive**: Added `coding/build-output.md` with RFC2119 rules for post-build artifact verification — MUST verify expected output files exist and are structurally valid after custom build scripts, especially non-compiled assets bundlers don't track; referenced from `coding/coding.md`; added `### Build Output Tests` section to `coding/testing.md`; codified root cause in `meta/lessons.md` (#105)
- **AGENTS.md Development Process**: Added "Development Process (always follow)" section codifying pre-code spec review, pre-commit `task check` gate, CHANGELOG/PR-template requirements, and commit message conventions — ensures agents follow deft conventions automatically via Warp project rules (partially addresses #114)

### Fixed
- **vBRIEF Generation Chain**: Fixed five-component vBRIEF generation chain that produced invalid `specification.vbrief.json` files — validator now enforces vBRIEF v0.5 schema (`vBRIEFInfo` envelope + `plan` object with `title`/`status`/`items`); migrated `specification.vbrief.json` and `plan.vbrief.json` from legacy flat format to conformant v0.5; renderer reads from new structure; `make-spec.md` and `deft-setup/SKILL.md` now include concrete vBRIEF output examples; `CONVENTIONS.md` corrected from documenting wrong format; `working-memory.md` example and `long-horizon.md` status lifecycle updated to v0.5 vocabulary; vBRIEF file validation tests added (#72, t1.2.1, t1.2.2)
- **vBRIEF Repo Reference Inconsistency**: Normalized vBRIEF source repo URL from `visionik/vBRIEF` to `deftai/vBRIEF` across `REFERENCES.md` and `vbrief/vbrief.md`
- **CLI Command Chaining Loop**: `cmd_project` no longer falls through and re-runs the entire questionnaire after `cmd_install` chains through `cmd_project` → `cmd_spec` — the original call now returns cleanly (#117, closes #91)
- **Strategy Selection Infinite Loop**: Strategy selection in `cmd_bootstrap` and `cmd_project` no longer enters an unbreakable loop when `strategies/` is empty or unresolvable — callers now warn and default to Interview when no strategy files are found (#92)
- **Strategy Fallback Value**: Strategy parsing fallback changed from deprecated `("default", "Default")` to `("interview", "Interview")` in both `cmd_bootstrap` and `cmd_project`
- **Broken Strategy Link in Generated Files**: Generated USER.md/PROJECT.md no longer writes a broken markdown link to `strategies/interview.md` when `strategies/` is empty — uses plain text instead (PR #120 review fix)

### Changed
- **Roadmap Triage**: Triaged issues #101–#108 into roadmap phases; #101 absorbed into #56; #105/#106 (directive gaps) and #107/#108 (language selection UX) added to Phase 1; #102/#103/#104 (docs/standards) added to Phase 2

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Agent Skill Auto-Discovery**: Added `.agents/skills/deft/`, `deft-setup/`, `deft-build/` thin pointer files to the repo — Warp and other agents now auto-discover deft skills on startup without user prompting (#94)
- **WriteAgentsSkills**: Installer now creates `.agents/skills/` in user project root during install so agents auto-discover deft skills immediately (#94)
- **Prescriptive Change Lifecycle Rule**: Added `! Before implementing any planned change that touches 3+ files or has an accepted plan artifact, propose /deft:change <name> and wait for confirmation` to `main.md` Decision Making section (#94)

### Changed
- **PrintNextSteps**: Installer output updated to reflect auto-discovery — no longer tells users to manually say 'read AGENTS.md and follow it' (#94)
- **AGENTS.md** (in-repo): Removed redundant Skills line — `.agents/skills/` handles discovery (#94)
- **agentsMDEntry**: Removed Skills line from install-generated AGENTS.md — `.agents/skills/` handles discovery, resolving the TODO from #75 (#94)

## [0.7.1] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **AGENTS.md Onboarding**: Install-generated `AGENTS.md` now contains self-contained bootstrap logic — first-session phase detection (USER.md → Phase 1, PROJECT.md → Phase 2, SPECIFICATION.md → Phase 3), returning-session guidance, and available commands reference (#54, closes #85)
- **Installer 'Next Steps' Output**: Removed false claim that agents read AGENTS.md automatically; users are now told to explicitly say `read AGENTS.md and follow it` with a note that auto-discovery is planned for a future release (#54, #85)
- **README Getting Started**: Removed false-automatic claims from Step 2 and manual clone path; added explicit agent kick-off instructions (#54, #85)
- **In-repo AGENTS.md**: Updated deft repo's own AGENTS.md with developer-focused content and correct root-relative paths (no `deft/` prefix) (#54)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-19

- **Trunk-Based Workflow**: Updated docs/workflow to remove stale beta-branch model and reflect short-lived feature branches (#69, #70)
- **Bootstrap Defaults**: `cmd_project` defaults project name from current directory and defaults "run spec now" to Yes (#47, #66)
- **Bootstrap Strategy Default**: Default strategy now uses `interview` instead of alphabetical first match (#66)
- **Tooling Dependency**: Bumped `black` from `26.3.0` to `26.3.1` (#48)
- **CHANGELOG Cleanup**: Backfilled post-0.6.0 entries, corrected release links to `deftai/directive`, and added missing `[Unreleased]` link reference (#71)

### Fixed
- **Double Prompting in Bootstrap Chain**: `cmd_project` now reads USER.md defaults (languages/strategy/coverage) instead of re-asking from scratch (#7, #43)
- **Ctrl+C Resume Protection**: Bootstrap/project flows now persist progress and support resume after interruption (#8, #66)
- **Input Validation Gaps**: Added validation for project type, language/strategy selections, coverage bounds, and duplicate selections (#44, #47, #66)
