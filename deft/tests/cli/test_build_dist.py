"""test_build_dist.py -- Tests for scripts/build_dist.py (#736).

Covers the cross-platform parity contract:

- Parametrized over Linux tar / Windows zip / macOS tar -- excluded paths
  (.git, dist, backup, node_modules) are absent from the produced
  artifact regardless of format.
- Expected core paths (scripts/, skills/, tasks/, AGENTS.md) are present
  in the produced artifact.
- Artifact size below a sanity ceiling (50 MB) so a regression that
  re-introduces the .git history would fail loudly.
- Idempotent re-run: invoking build twice does NOT ingest the prior
  dist/ artifact into the new archive.
- ``--exclude-extra`` flag extends the canonical exclude list.
- End-to-end smoke: invoke ``task build`` and confirm the Python helper
  ran and an artifact landed in dist/. Skipped when the ``task`` binary
  is not on PATH (mirrors tests/content/test_taskfile_caching.py and
  tests/content/test_taskfile_release_names.py).

The format-selection function is exercised independently so platform
behaviour is asserted without monkeypatching ``sys.platform`` for the
whole test session.
