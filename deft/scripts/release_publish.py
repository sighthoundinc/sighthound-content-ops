"""release_publish.py -- Flip a draft GitHub release to public (#716).

Companion to ``scripts/release.py`` per the #716 safety hardening.
``task release`` lands the release as a draft so the *artifact
production* phase (release.yml CI + binary upload) is decoupled from
the *consumer-visibility* phase. After manually reviewing the draft's
binaries / notes / asset list, the operator runs::

    task release:publish -- <version>

which dispatches this script to flip the release out of draft state.

Pipeline
--------
1. Pre-flight: verify the release exists and is in draft state via the
   GitHub REST API. The lookup uses a paginated list+filter against
   ``GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases?per_page=100`` (with
   ``gh api --paginate`` following ``Link: rel="next"`` headers) and
   matches the first entry whose ``tag_name`` equals ``v<version>``.
   State machine:

   - **not-found** -> exit 1 (cannot publish a release that does not exist)
   - **already-published** -> exit 0 no-op (publish is idempotent; running
     it twice is safe)
   - **draft** -> proceed
2. Flip the draft state via REST PATCH:
   ``PATCH /repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/{id}`` with ``draft=false``.
3. Re-read the release and verify the draft state actually flipped.
4. Print summary line; return exit 0.

REST internals (#961, #1016)
----------------------------
The v0.26.1 publish failed (2026-05-07) at the GraphQL bucket
exhaustion mid-cascade: the legacy ``gh release view --json ...`` and
``gh release edit ... --draft=false`` subcommands both routed through
GraphQL and failed hard when the bucket hit zero. Per ``meta/lessons.md``
``## gh CLI GraphQL Bucket Exhaustion + REST Fallback + UTF-8 Payload
Pattern (2026-05)`` and the canonical preamble in
``templates/agent-prompt-preamble.md`` S5 (REST-by-default rule), this
script uses ``gh api`` directly against REST endpoints, which bill
the ``core`` bucket (independent of ``graphql``).

#1016 follow-up: the v0.27.0 publish (2026-05-10) failed against a
DRAFT release because the original #961 implementation called
``GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/tags/{tag}``, which the GitHub
REST docs explicitly limit to PUBLISHED releases ("This returns the
latest published release for the specified tag"). DRAFT releases were
filtered out at the API layer, so ``release_publish.py`` 404'd on the
canonical case it was supposed to handle. The fix (option 2 from #1016)
replaces the single ``/releases/tags/{tag}`` call with a paginated
list+filter against ``GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases?per_page=100``
(via ``gh api --paginate``), then matches the first entry whose
``tag_name`` equals the target. This stays within the REST core bucket
and surfaces drafts.

Release helpers are intentionally NOT routed through
``scripts/gh_rest.py`` (#961) because the issue body explicitly carves
releases out as ``task release`` (#74) territory; this module owns its
two inline REST calls without extending the cross-cutting helper
surface. See module docstring of ``scripts/gh_rest.py`` for the
rationale.

The internal ``payload`` shape returned by :func:`view_release` is
normalised to the legacy field names (``isDraft``, ``tagName``,
``url``, ``name``) regardless of which REST keys the upstream API
uses, so :func:`run_publish` and existing tests do not care that the
underlying transport changed.

Exit codes
----------
    0 -- release published (or already-published no-op)
    1 -- pre-flight or step-level violation (release missing, gh failure,
         post-edit verification mismatch)
    2 -- config / argument error (malformed version, repo unresolvable, ...)
