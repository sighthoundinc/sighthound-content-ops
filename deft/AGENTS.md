# Deft — Development Framework (deft repo)

You are working inside the deft framework repository itself.
Full guidelines: main.md

## First Session (deft development)

Check what exists before doing anything else:

**USER.md missing** (~/.config/deft/USER.md or %APPDATA%\deft\USER.md):
→ Read skills/deft-setup/SKILL.md and start Phase 1 (user preferences)

**USER.md exists, PROJECT.md missing** (repo root):
→ Read skills/deft-setup/SKILL.md and start Phase 2 (project configuration)

**USER.md and PROJECT.md exist, SPECIFICATION.md missing** (repo root):
→ Read skills/deft-setup/SKILL.md and start Phase 3 (specification interview)

## Returning Sessions

When all config exists: read the guidelines, your USER.md preferences, and PROJECT.md, then continue with your task.

Install-generated AGENTS.md uses deft/-prefixed paths.
