"""Content tests for the detection-bound branch gate (#747).

Asserts the surfaces around `scripts/preflight_branch.py` exist and
reference each other consistently:

- ``.githooks/pre-commit`` and ``.githooks/pre-push`` exist and call the
  preflight script.
- ``Taskfile.yml`` aggregate ``check`` task includes ``verify:branch``.
- ``tasks/verify.yml`` declares ``branch`` and ``hooks-installed`` tasks.
- ``tasks/policy.yml`` declares the policy:* surface.
- ``.github/workflows/branch-gate.yml`` rejects ``head_ref == base_ref``.
- AGENTS.md and main.md reference the policy + enforcement surfaces.
- README.md has the Branch policy section.
- ``Taskfile.yml`` has a top-level ``setup`` task that sets
  ``core.hooksPath`` idempotently.

Pure content-string assertions -- no subprocess, no go-task dispatch.
