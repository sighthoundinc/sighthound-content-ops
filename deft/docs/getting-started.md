# Getting Started with Deft Directive

Deft Directive is a Markdown framework that provides layered behavioral rules, workflow strategies, and quality gates for AI-assisted software development. This guide walks you through installing Deft, configuring your preferences, creating your first project specification, and using strategies to drive implementation.

> **Note**: Full guide content is deferred until Phases 1-3 of the Deft Directive specification ship. This stub establishes the document structure; sections will be fleshed out as the framework stabilises. See SPECIFICATION.md and ROADMAP.md for current status.

## Prerequisites

<!-- TODO: Document required tools (Go 1.22+, Python 3.11+, uv, task) and supported platforms -->

---

## Installation

Download a platform installer from the Deft release page and run it from the
project you want to adopt:

```bash
deft-install --yes --repo-root . --json
```

For existing consumer projects, the headless upgrade path is:

```bash
deft-install --yes --upgrade --repo-root . --json
```

Those consumer flows intentionally project Deft-managed files into your project
root (`AGENTS.md`, skills pointers, gitignore entries, vbrief scaffolding, and
related guard configuration). Framework maintainers working inside a
`deftai/directive` checkout should instead follow
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) and use `--maintainer`; maintainer setup
checks tools without rewriting consumer-managed files.

## Working an existing backlog

If you are adopting Deft on a project that already has an issue tracker (existing repo, brownfield migration, an upstream bug list that has been accumulating), you do not have to start from an empty `vbrief/proposed/`. The refinement skill's **Phase 0 triage workflow** lets you walk an existing backlog locally, decide what to keep, and let only the **accepted** items land in `vbrief/proposed/`. Trigger words: **"triage"**, **"work the cache"**, **"pre-ingest"**, **"action menu"**.

### Step 1 — Scoped first populate

A real-sized backlog can drain the shared GitHub GraphQL bucket if you fetch everything at once (see [#976](https://github.com/deftai/directive/issues/976) for the recurring symptom). Scope the first populate so it lands in seconds rather than minutes:

```bash
task triage:bootstrap -- --limit 50 --state open
```

Flag surface (shared by `task triage:bootstrap` and `task cache:fetch-all`):

- `--limit <N>` caps the number of issues fetched (start with `50` and widen as needed).
- `--state {open|closed|all}` selects the issue state (default `open`).
- `--batch-size <N>` caps the per-page fetch (default `10`).
- `--delay-ms <N>` inserts a sleep between batches so a populate against a large repo does not trip the rate limiter (default `500`; a `429` retries automatically using the upstream `Retry-After` header).
- `--repo OWNER/NAME` is optional; when omitted, the bootstrap infers the slug from `git remote get-url origin`.

The unbounded no-flag form remains the default for small backlogs. For real-sized repos, prefer the scoped first run; you can always re-enter triage later to widen the slice.

### Step 2 — Walk the action menu

After the cache is populated, ask your agent to triage. For each cached candidate the agent presents a numbered action menu and waits for your decision:

```
1. Accept         -- task triage:accept <issue>          (writes proposed/ vBRIEF + audit-log entry)
2. Reject         -- task triage:reject <issue>          (audit-log entry only; closes the upstream issue)
3. Defer          -- task triage:defer <issue>           (non-terminal; resurfaces on the next pass)
4. Needs-AC       -- task triage:needs-ac <issue>        (non-terminal; flags missing acceptance criteria)
5. Mark duplicate -- task triage:mark-duplicate <a> <b>  (terminal; cross-links the duplicate target)
6. Discuss
7. Back
```

Only **accepted** items become scope vBRIEFs in `vbrief/proposed/`. Rejected, deferred, and duplicate decisions are recorded in the audit log so the backlog stays focused. Bulk verbs (`task triage:bulk-accept` / `bulk-reject` / `bulk-defer` / `bulk-needs-ac`) handle predictable patterns (e.g. "reject every `wontfix`-labelled candidate") without walking the menu N times.

### Step 3 — Understand the three-tier model

Phase 0 reads and writes three distinct stores; they never collapse into one:

- **Cache** — `.deft-cache/github-issue/<owner>/<repo>/<N>/` is the local mirror of fetched issue bodies, labels, and state. Populated by `task cache:fetch-all`; read via `task cache:get -- github-issue OWNER/NAME/<N>`. The directory is gitignored — your local mirror is private to your machine. The cache is the **read** surface for triage so decisions are reproducible across re-runs (no live `gh issue view` per decision).
- **Audit log** — `vbrief/.eval/candidates.jsonl` is an append-only JSONL recording every candidate you have ever seen plus the action taken (`accept | reject | defer | needs-ac | mark-duplicate`) and a timestamp. Re-running triage against the same cache short-circuits items that already have a terminal entry, so deferred / Needs-AC items resurface and rejected ones do not.
- **Accepted backlog** — `vbrief/proposed/` is the standard scope-vBRIEF lifecycle folder. **Writes flow only through `task triage:accept`**, which delegates the actual vBRIEF authoring to `task issue:ingest` so slug, reference, and schema rules stay in one place. Hand-authored proposed/ vBRIEFs are still allowed; what changed is that triage no longer writes there silently.

### Step 4 — Why this avoids the GraphQL drain

The shared GitHub GraphQL bucket (5000 points/hour per identity) is the operational bottleneck under multi-agent / shared-identity workflows, not the REST `core` bucket. The triage cache is **REST-backed** (`gh api` reads, not `gh issue view --json`), and the populate uses **batched delays** plus automatic 429 retries with the upstream `Retry-After` header. There is no live `gh issue view` per accept / reject / defer decision — every decision reads from the local cache. This is why the scoped flags exist: they let you keep the populate inside the REST budget and well clear of the GraphQL bottleneck (see [#976](https://github.com/deftai/directive/issues/976) for the recurrence pattern). Refresh the cache on demand with `task cache:fetch-all` (idempotent — fresh entries are skipped) or audit drift against `vbrief/active/*.vbrief.json` with `task triage:refresh-active`.

Full command reference for every triage and cache verb lives in [`commands.md` § Backlog triage & cache tasks](../commands.md#backlog-triage--cache-tasks); the canonical agent-facing description of the workflow lives in `skills/deft-directive-refinement/SKILL.md` Phase 0.
