"""tests/cli/test_framework_doctor_prose.py -- doctor FAIL-prose regression (#1061).

Asserts every command string surfaced in :mod:`scripts.doctor` (retired framework_doctor.py)
FAIL / REPAIR ``detail`` messages either:

(a) exists as a Taskfile target reachable from a consumer install
    (root ``Taskfile.yml`` or any ``tasks/*.yml`` fragment), or
(b) matches a documented ``run`` subcommand (registered in the ``commands``
    dispatch table at ``run::main``).

The doctor's FAIL prose is the user-facing surface for every drift report;
when it names a command that does not exist, the operator follows the
recommendation, gets a ``task: No tasks with description available`` error,
and has to grep for the real surface. This regression caught that exact
failure mode for ``task upgrade`` in #1061 -- the doctor prose cited a
Taskfile target that did not exist; the test below would have failed
fast on PR review instead of shipping the broken recommendation.

The structural contract this test enforces:

1. For every FAIL ``detail`` produced by the four core checks
   (``_check_quick_start_resolves``, ``_check_skill_paths_resolve``,
   ``_check_manifest_agreement``, ``_check_install_path_consistency``)
   AND the synthetic ``agents-md-present`` FAIL emitted by
   :func:`_run_checks_impl` when AGENTS.md is missing, EVERY ``\\`...\\```
   command surfaced MUST be either:
   (a) ``task <X>`` where ``X`` is a documented Taskfile target, or
   (b) ``.deft/core/run <X>`` (Unix) / ``.deft\\core\\run <X>`` (Windows)
       where ``<X>`` is a documented ``run`` subcommand.

2. The structured ``data.suggested_fix`` / ``data.suggested_fix_alt``
   fields added in #1061 MUST also resolve to a real command surface.

Test seam: each check is driven through ``doctor.run_checks``
against a contrived drift state so we can capture the real FAIL ``detail``
strings and assert against the actual production prose.
