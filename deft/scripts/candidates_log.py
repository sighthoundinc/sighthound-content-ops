"""Append-only audit log for triage decisions (#845 Story 2).

Public surface:
    append(entry: dict) -> str             # returns decision_id
    read_all(repo: str | None = None) -> list[dict]
    find_by_issue(issue_number: int, repo: str) -> list[dict]
    latest_decision(issue_number: int, repo: str) -> dict | None

Storage:
    vbrief/.eval/candidates.jsonl -- one JSON object per line, UTF-8.
    Parent directory is created on first append.

Concurrency:
    - Cross-process safety: an advisory lock is held on a sidecar
      ``candidates.jsonl.lock`` file via ``msvcrt.locking`` on Windows and
      ``fcntl.flock`` on POSIX while the writer appends a single line.
    - In-process thread safety: a module-level ``threading.Lock`` serialises
      appends from threads in the same Python process so the line-level
      atomicity holds even when the OS-level byte-range lock would otherwise
      be granted to multiple file descriptors held by the same process.

Validation:
    Every dict passed to :func:`append` is validated against the constraints
    in ``vbrief/schemas/candidates.schema.json`` (the FROZEN interface
    contract for downstream agents A3, A4, A6). The validator is hand-rolled
    so this module has no third-party dependency footprint -- the schema
    file remains the canonical reference.

Tolerance:
    :func:`read_all` tolerates malformed JSON lines: it logs a warning and
    skips them rather than raising. A partially-written tail from a crashed
    appender must not brick the audit trail for downstream readers.
