# Deft Directive — Roadmap

Prioritized work items. **Principle: resolve open issues before new features.**

---

## Phase 1 — Bug Fixes & Issue Resolution (Next Up)

Fix reported bugs and UX problems blocking adoption.

### Adoption Blockers (user-reported, highest priority)

- **#94** — Agent auto-alignment on startup: thin .agents/skills/deft/SKILL.md pointer (no symlinks/copies) + prescriptive change lifecycle rule in main.md (depends on #54)
- **#54** — AGENTS.md provides no actionable onboarding — agents don't know what to do after deft-install; installer 'Next steps' lies about automatic behavior; README lacks kick-off instructions (absorbed #85)
- **#79** — deft-setup Phase 2 inference bleeds into `./deft/` framework internals (misidentifies project as "deft")
- **#80** — deft-setup Phase 2 project name inference has no fallback when no build files exist
- **#72** — vBRIEF files still invalid on master — users get non-conforming JSON output
- **#68** — Warp not always enforcing Deft testing protocols (core quality gates silently skipped)

### Cleanup

- **#31** — `default.md` and `interview.md` need to be merged into `interview.md` (duplicate strategy files)
- **#50** — Strategies still have redundant old names (`brownfield.md` → `map.md`, `default.md` → `interview.md`)
- **#49** — All CLI commands should display version on startup

---

## Phase 2 — Documentation & Content Fixes

Quick doc/content fixes that don't require code changes.

### Philosophy & Positioning

- **#89** — Deft identity and positioning: resolve naming before README reframe (blocks #84 Phase 2 README reframe, `meta/philosophy.md`, interview strategy updates)
- **#84 Phase 1** — Deft as teacher: contract hierarchy, adaptive teaching, and "state WHY"
  - Add `! State WHY` rule to `strategies/interview.md` — when making an opinionated recommendation, state the principle (1 sentence)
  - Create `contracts/hierarchy.md` — Standards > APIs > Specs > Code ranking, Phoenix architecture concept, "contracts are your IP" framing
  - Add adaptive teaching behavior to `main.md` (always-loaded; not `SOUL.md` — opt-in only):
    - `~ When a recommendation is accepted without question, be concise`
    - `! When a recommendation is questioned or overridden, explain the reasoning`
    - `⊗ Lecture unprompted on every decision`

### Content & Doc Fixes

- **#58** — Stale cross-references to legacy `core/user.md` and `core/project.md` paths throughout framework
- **#59** — `history/changes/` directory referenced by `commands.md` doesn't exist
- **#23** — `yolo.md` duplicates ~80% of `interview.md` — refactor to reference shared phases
- **#24** — `speckit.md` missing `⚠️ See also` cross-reference banner
- **#25** — `commands.md` vBRIEF example diverges from `vbrief/vbrief.md` spec (status vocabulary mismatch)
- **#67** — Write SPECIFICATION.md and proper PROJECT.md for the deft project itself
- **#51** — Project should be fully bootstrapped with its own framework (partially done in PR #66)
- Rename: purge remaining "Warping" references from README.md, `warping.sh`, Taskfile.yml; reframe README per #89 resolution (#84 Phase 2, blocked on #89)
  - `README.md` still says "Warping Process", "What is Warping?", "Contributing to Warping"
  - Reframe from "coding standards framework" → resolved tagline from #89
  - `Taskfile.yml` `VERSION` — update to match latest release
  - `warping.sh` still present — remove or deprecate (replaced by `run` in v0.5.0)
  - Verify: `test_standards.py` xfail for Warping references should flip to passing
- Clean leaked personal files:
  - `core/project.md` — contains Voxio Bot private project config; replace with generic template
  - `PROJECT.md` (repo root) — leftover from bootstrap test run; remove or replace
  - Verify: `test_standards.py` xfail for Voxio Bot content should flip to passing
- Update `strategies/interview.md` to probe language/tool choices through the contract lens — when user picks a language, prompt to consider habit vs. suitability (#84 Phase 2)
- Create `meta/philosophy.md` — full contract hierarchy narrative for agent reference and direct user reading (#84 Phase 2)
- **#82** — Replacement strategies need accept-or-scrap exit when plan artifacts already exist (design: artifact awareness for chaining gate)
- **#81** — Add BDD/acceptance-test-first strategy (`strategies/bdd.md` — Given/When/Then scenarios drive requirements)
- Add missing strategies:
  - `strategies/rapid.md` — Quick prototypes, SPECIFICATION only workflow
  - `strategies/enterprise.md` — Compliance-heavy, PRD → ADR → SPECIFICATION workflow
  - Both listed in `strategies/README.md` as "(future)" with no backing file
- Port any remaining `SKILL.md` carry-forward content from master
  - Three commits on master updated SKILL.md (`a6f120a`, `cc442fc`, `2f2a89e`)
  - Largely superseded by `deft-setup`/`deft-build` skills; review for carry-forward content
- Codify PR workflow standards into `scm/github.md`
  - Opinionated PR workflow rules: single-purpose PRs, review required, squash-merge, well-documented
  - Cross-reference squash-merge rule in Branch Protection settings section
  - Branch lifecycle: delete remote branch on merge; prune local branches after pull
- ~~Write remaining CHANGELOG entries~~ — tracked by #71 (Phase 1)

---

## Phase 3 — Test Infrastructure & CI

- **#74** — Automate release process (`task release`) and CI changelog enforcement
- **#57** — Add GitHub Actions CI workflow for linting and tests on PRs and pushes
- **#33** — When using Docker, smoke tests and e2e tests should validate Docker (docker:up, /healthz)
- CLI tests for remaining commands: `cmd_spec`, `cmd_install`, `cmd_reset`, `cmd_update`
- Error and edge case testing for core CLI commands
- Enforce USER.md gate in CLI path
  - `cmd_spec` and `cmd_project` should check for USER.md at entry; if absent, warn and redirect to `run bootstrap`
  - Skills path already done (deft-build); this covers the CLI fallback path only
- Code signing for installer binaries (Windows Authenticode, macOS Developer ID + notarisation)
- Low-end LLM compatibility testing
  - Validate installer and agent process (deft-setup, deft-build) on small/quantised models (e.g. Qwen3-9B)
  - Ensure strategies, interview flow, and spec generation still produce good results
  - Document minimum recommended model size in README or AGENTS.md
- Upgrade GitHub Actions to Node.js 24 before June 2, 2026 deadline
  - `actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-go`, `actions/upload-artifact`, `actions/download-artifact`
  - Bump to versions that support Node.js 24 when available (v5+), or set `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24=true`

---

## Phase 4 — Package Distribution & Install UX

Publish deft as NPM + PIP CLI packages for developer-audience install.
Complements the Go installer (which targets novice/bare-machine users).

- **#56** — Reduce installation friction — add shell one-liner, Homebrew, and platform package managers
- **#53** — deft-install should bootstrap the current directory by default
- **#75** — Skill auto-discovery: make deft skills work in both user projects and deft development (symlinks/copies to `.agents/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, etc.) *(depends on #54)*
- **#11** — NPM + PIP CLI distribution (`npm i -g @deftai/directive`, `pipx install deft-cli`)

**Prerequisites:** Phase 2 complete (clean content), issue #4 resolved (project-local layout)

Scope: `deft install`, `deft bootstrap`, `deft update`, `deft doctor` commands,
GitHub Actions publish workflows (tag → npm publish + twine upload),
README updated with NPM + PIP install paths alongside Go binary.

---

## Phase 5 — CLI Overhaul & New Features

Larger feature work — only after issues are resolved and content is stable.

- **#84 Phase 3** — Deft as teacher: teach strategy, lessons evolution
  - Build `strategies/teach.md` — Feynman technique applied to Deft itself, philosophy as a conversation
  - Evolve `lessons.md` — when adding a lesson, include not just *what* was learned but *why it matters* in the contract hierarchy
- **#52** — Install into `.deft/` (hidden directory) instead of `deft/`
- **#55** — Register Deft commands as native agent slash commands (Claude Code, Copilot, Gemini, etc.) — also absorbs slash-command registration scope from #54
- **#46** — Provide a way for users to update meta MD files (SOUL, MORALS, CODE-FIELD, USER, etc.)
- **#77** — Allow users to change technical rating (1/2/3) when starting a new project
- **#78** — Bootstrap: offer to update user preferences when USER.md already exists
- **#86** — Artifact-branch binding and complete audit trail for SDD (dual-format persistence, branch lifecycle hooks, artifact manifest)
- **#76** — Obsidian Vault generation as structured agent memory (interlinked markdown notes, per-agent knowledge scopes)
- **#12** — Deft Bootstrap CLI with TUI (Typer + Textual, strategy-aware feature branching, agent config generation)
- **#9** — Issue tracking system integration (GitHub Issues, Jira, Asana — optional, via MCP)
- **#95** — Compliance-aligned constitution templates + readiness scanners (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, HiTrust); sub-issues #96–#100 cover config schema, control mapping registry, scoring, evidence gap analysis, and automation hooks
- LLM-assisted content validation
- Self-upgrade to Deft Directive product (branding, public docs, distribution packaging)
