"""agents-entry.md path-flip pin (#1046 PR-A AC-1 / #1045).

Asserts ``templates/agents-entry.md`` -- the single source of truth for the
managed-section content rendered into every consumer's ``AGENTS.md`` -- no
longer carries any legacy ``deft/<thing>/`` install-path literal after the
#1046 PR-A canonical-path enforcement (which absorbs the standalone #1045
path-flip issue per the cohort ADR PR #1051).

The actual flip itself landed in PR #1043 (commit ``985a7f2``) as part of
the v0.27.1 installer conformance recheck (#1020); this contract test pins
the post-flip state so a future edit that re-introduces a legacy literal
fails CI immediately rather than silently regressing the rendered managed
section back to the broken-path-loop state issue #1046 documents.

Why this regression matters
---------------------------

When the managed section declares an install path that does not resolve on
disk, the consumer's session-start routing enters a documented no-op Case G
refresh loop (per issue #1046 finding #2): the loop detects "AGENTS.md
references paths that don't exist", refreshes the managed section with
byte-identical bytes, reports success, and the next session re-detects the
same staleness. The canonical-path flip from #1043 closes that loop by
making the on-disk install location agree with what AGENTS.md declares for
the v0.27 install contract. A re-introduction of ``deft/<thing>/`` would
re-open the loop.

Mirrors the existing ``tests/contract/test_no_legacy_deft_run.py`` pattern
but scoped to the rendered managed-section template specifically.

Exclusions
----------

User-config paths under ``~/.config/deft/`` (XDG-ish) and
``%APPDATA%\\deft\\`` (Windows-ish) are NOT subject to this flip -- they
point at the consumer's USER.md location, not the framework install path.
The detector below filters those occurrences out by line context so the
Platform Detection wording in ``First Session`` (which legitimately
references both ``~/.config/deft/USER.md`` and ``%APPDATA%\\deft\\USER.md``)
remains untouched.

PR-C carve-out
--------------

The PR-A cohort scope leaves the Implementation Intent Gate block in
``templates/agents-entry.md`` untouched for PR-C, which will rewrite the
prose around the gate's Taskfile target into a resolver-based contract per
the ADR. The current template already carries the canonical
``.deft/core/scripts/preflight_implementation.py`` literal (flipped by
#1043 alongside the rest of the body), so this test simply checks for the
ABSENCE of the legacy form -- a forward-only assertion that does not block
PR-C's planned rewrite.

Story: #1046 PR-A (acceptance criterion AC-1) -- absorbs #1045.
