"""test_release_workflow.py -- Guard-rail tests for #733.

The deft release workflow MUST NOT auto-publish releases. Per #716 (Phase 5
user-only authority gate) and #733 (this regression), publish authority
belongs exclusively to ``task release:publish`` (which runs
``gh release edit --draft=false`` under operator review). The workflow's
``release`` job is BUILD AND UPLOAD only.

This module parses ``.github/workflows/release.yml`` and asserts:

1. Every ``softprops/action-gh-release@v*`` usage carries ``draft: true``
   (the action's default is ``false``, so an unset ``draft`` key is the
   same defect as ``draft: false`` -- both flip the release to public).
2. No step runs ``gh release edit --draft=false``.
3. No step otherwise flips ``isDraft: false``.

The tests are deliberately string/regex based rather than YAML-parsed --
PyYAML is not in the project's dev dependencies (per ``pyproject.toml``)
and the workflow's structure is stable enough that a regex scan with a
narrow context window is sufficient. If a future contributor adds a third
mechanism to flip drafts (e.g. another action), the catch-all assertions
will surface it.

Refs:
  - deftai/directive#733 -- root regression issue
  - deftai/directive#716 -- Phase 5 safety hardening / user-only authority
  - deftai/directive#1072 -- SHA-pin every remote ``uses:`` (the action
    reference is now a 40-char commit SHA with a ``# vX.Y.Z`` trailing
    comment; the detector below accepts BOTH the legacy ``@vN`` floating
    form AND the SHA-pinned form so the ``draft: true`` contract pins
    independently of how the upstream version reference is encoded).
