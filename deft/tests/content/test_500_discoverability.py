"""test_500_discoverability.py -- Tests for #500 pre-cutover migration discoverability.

Scope: per #506 D6, Agent E (#500) is responsible for:
  A. documenting the deft/Taskfile.yml include pattern in deft/main.md and
     deft/QUICK-START.md so `task migrate:vbrief` resolves from project root
  B. updating the setup SKILL.md pre-cutover guard with a task-resolvability
     check and the `task -t ./deft/Taskfile.yml migrate:vbrief` fallback
  C. adding a pre-cutover detection branch to the consumer AGENTS.md
     (templates/agents-entry.md) BEFORE Phase 1/2/Returning
  D. adding a ``## Migrating from pre-v0.20`` section to deft/main.md,
     cross-linked from AGENTS.md pre-cutover branch and deft/QUICK-START.md
  skip-ii. NOT adding install-step Taskfile mutation (#506 D6 explicitly
     skips option ii); these tests therefore assert the absence of such
     mutation language.

This module asserts the contract documented in
``vbrief/active/2026-04-21-500-migration-discoverability.vbrief.json``.
