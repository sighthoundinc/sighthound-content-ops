"""Regression tests for the Greptile / SLizard findings detector baked into
``templates/swarm-greptile-poller-prompt.md`` (#910 + #1035).

The template body prescribes the detector that every dispatched poller agent
copies into its poll script. Four independent surface forms have been
observed in the wild across two recurrence events:

1. **Tier 1**   -- HTML severity badges (``<img alt="P0"`` / ``<img alt="P1"``).
2. **Tier 2**   -- markdown-bullet bold (``- **P1 -- ...**``).
3. **Tier 2.5** -- SLizard `### P[01] · ...` heading form (#1035, PR #1034).
4. **Tier 3**   -- inline prose (``Three P1 findings ...``, ``Not safe to merge``,
   ``^P1 -- ...``).

Three false-negatives in the v0.25.1 swarm session (#907 first review, #908
first review, #908 retrigger) drove the move from a badge-only detector to the
triple-tier detector under #910. A subsequent live miss on PR #1034
(2026-05-11, #1035) -- where SLizard rendered a P1 finding as a `### P1 ·`
heading paired with a `## Confidence Score: 3/5` markdown header -- drove the
Tier 2.5 + confidence-heading parser fallback in this module. These tests pin
both regressions so a future template edit that drops or weakens any tier
fails CI immediately.

The tests exercise a Python *reference implementation* of the detector (mirror
of the template body) AND assert the template still contains the canonical
regex strings / sentinels so the two stay in sync.
