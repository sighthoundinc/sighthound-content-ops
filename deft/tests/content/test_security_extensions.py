"""
test_security_extensions.py -- Deterministic content regression for the
three Wave 2 security cohort extensions to `coding/security.md`:

* #587 -- No-read-secret rule for agent systems
* #686 -- Tool-call safety is independent of text-level safety
* #708 -- Destructive-op guardrails (env-isolation + irreversibility gates)
          plus the `incidents/` library and seed entry

Per the Rule Authority [AXIOM] in `main.md` the strongest applicable
encoding tier for a prose rule is a deterministic content test. This
module pins:

1. Each new section heading is present in `coding/security.md`.
2. Each new section carries the load-bearing MUST + MUST NOT tokens.
3. Each new section cross-references its companion artefacts.
4. The `incidents/` library exists with README, template, and seed entry.
5. The seed entry cross-references the rule body for #587, #686, and #708.

A future rename, section drop, or accidental deletion of any cross-
reference fails this lane before the change can land via `task check`.
