Guard-rail test for #578.

Ensures that any ``SKILL.md`` across the repo which declares an ``os:``
frontmatter key lists ALL three currently-supported operating systems:
``darwin``, ``linux``, and ``windows``.

Background
----------

``deft/SKILL.md`` originally declared ``os: ["darwin", "linux"]`` in its
YAML frontmatter, omitting ``"windows"``.  That metadata contradicted
observable framework behaviour:

* ``#568`` added a ``windows-task-dispatch`` CI matrix job on
  ``windows-latest``.
* Multiple skills (``deft-directive-setup``, ``deft-directive-build``,
  ...) carry explicit Platform Detection sections that resolve Windows
  paths (e.g. ``%APPDATA%\\deft\\USER.md``).
* ``scripts/migrate_vbrief.py`` handles Windows-specific concerns
  (CRLF, ``.gitignore`` append on Windows projects, ...).
* RC3 validation (``MScottAdams/slizard-rc3-test``) ran the full deft
  consumer migration on Windows 11 + pwsh 5.1.

Depending on how the clawdbot skill loader interprets this field, a
missing ``"windows"`` entry risks silently filtering deft out for
Windows consumers.  The fix in #578 adds ``"windows"`` to the array
(Option A, preferred) or removes the field entirely (Option B).

Invariants enforced
-------------------

This module enforces two invariants via parametrized tests:

1. ``test_skill_os_frontmatter_includes_all_supported_oses`` -- every
   ``SKILL.md`` whose YAML frontmatter contains an ``os:`` key MUST
   list all of ``darwin``, ``linux``, and ``windows`` in the array.
   Files that omit the key entirely (Option B) are exempt.
2. ``test_skill_frontmatter_discovery_found_files`` -- sanity check:
   the ``SKILL.md`` discovery glob must find at least one candidate
   file.  Guards against a silent glob regression that would make the
   first test trivially pass on zero parametrized inputs.

The guard-rail style mirrors ``test_taskfile_paths.py`` (added in
``#568``): discover all candidate files, parametrize one test per file,
assert the invariant with a helpful failure message.

See:
  - deftai/directive#578 -- root issue
  - deft/SKILL.md -- the file originally missing ``"windows"``
  - tests/content/test_taskfile_paths.py -- sibling guard-rail pattern
