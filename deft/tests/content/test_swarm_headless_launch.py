"""Content tests for the headless / low-ceremony swarm launch prose contract (#1387).

#1387 documents a headless launch path in the swarm skill so an operator with a
pre-approved cohort can launch with a SINGLE consent (the #1378 allocation-context
token) instead of the per-phase interactive gates. The prose lands in two surfaces
that MUST agree:

  * ``skills/deft-directive-swarm/SKILL.md`` -- Phase 0 headless cohort fast-path
    (routes through the C1 ``task swarm:launch`` CLI, skips the promote-fill loop),
    Phase 2 Step 1 Mode A (accepts a pre-created C3 worktree map), and Phase 3
    Step 0.5 (consumes the C2 launch-manifest as dispatch prep; the spawn stays
    agent-driven via Step 2a / 2d).
  * ``AGENTS.md`` -- a concise gate-stack mirror so both surfaces stay in lockstep.

These tests pin the load-bearing tokens (the C1 / C2 / C3 contract names,
``swarm:launch``, the pre-created worktree map, and launch-manifest consumption)
so a future copy-edit that silently drops the headless contract fails CI. Stable
substring matches (not full-text); failure messages cite the file path + the
missing token. Mirrors the block-bounded pattern in
``tests/content/test_swarm_skill.py`` and
``tests/content/test_allocation_context_skills.py``.

The ``\u2297`` (U+2297) MUST NOT glyph is written via its escape sequence to keep
this test file clean against the #798 encoding gate.
