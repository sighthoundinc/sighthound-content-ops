"""verify_encoding.py -- deterministic gate against PS 5.1 non-ASCII round-trip corruption (#798).

Pure stdlib, cross-platform. Invoked from:

- ``.githooks/pre-commit`` via ``--staged`` after ``preflight_branch.py`` (#747)
- ``task verify:encoding`` (aggregated into ``task check``) via ``--all``
- ``uv run python scripts/verify_encoding.py [--staged|--all] [--allow-list <path>]``

Recurrence chain (this gate elevates the rule from prose tier to deterministic
tier per main.md Rule Authority [AXIOM]):

- #236 t1.11.1 -- ``Get-Content -Raw`` + BOM-safe write rules in scm/github.md
- #240 t1.11.2 -- Warp multi-line PS here-string rule in scm/github.md
- #283 t1.20.1 -- ``New-Object System.Text.UTF8Encoding $false`` rule in AGENTS.md
- PR #795 (2026-05-01) -- 132-line CHANGELOG mojibake on the same maintainer
  with all three rules loaded, because the corruption happened on the READ side
  (``Get-Content -Raw`` decodes via the active codepage, typically CP1252 or
  CP437 on Windows) BEFORE any safe write could preserve the bytes.

Detection scope (UTF-8 codepoint sequences that appear after a Windows
codepage round-trip):

- U+FFFD replacement chars (universal corruption marker).
- CP1252-as-UTF-8 mojibake bigrams (``Â§``, ``Â°``, ``â€™``, ``â€¦``, ``â†'`` ...).
- CP437-as-UTF-8 mojibake bigrams (``Γèù``, ``Γ£ô``, ``ΓÇª``, ``ΓÇö`` ...).
- Unexpected UTF-8 BOM (``EF BB BF``) on text formats where BOM is non-canonical
  (.md, .json, .yml, .yaml, .txt).

False-positive guards:

- Markdown inline code spans (single backticks) and fenced code blocks (triple
  backticks) are stripped before scanning .md files -- recurrence-record prose
  legitimately quotes mojibake bytes inside backticks.
- A built-in allow-list skips the #798 brief itself (which documents the
  bigram catalog as part of its acceptance criteria).
- ``--allow-list <path>`` accepts a newline-separated list of glob patterns
  for project-specific documented exceptions (e.g. regression fixtures).

Exit codes (three-state, mirrors ``scripts/preflight_branch.py``):

- ``0`` -- clean: no mojibake / U+FFFD / unexpected BOM detected.
- ``1`` -- corruption found: prints per-hit ``path:line:[label] context``.
- ``2`` -- config error: ``--allow-list`` path unreadable, ``--staged``
  outside a git repo, or unrecognised CLI shape.
