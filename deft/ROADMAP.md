# Deft Directive -- Roadmap

Prioritized work items. **Principle: resolve open issues before new features.**

---

## Phase 1 -- Bug Fixes & Issue Resolution (Next Up)

Fix reported bugs and UX problems blocking adoption.
### Adoption Blockers (user-reported, highest priority)


### Cleanup

- **#249** -- fix(skill): deft-swarm Phase 6 missing autonomous Greptile re-review monitoring during rebase cascade (add tiered monitoring step after each force-push; reference deft-review-cycle tiered approach)
- **#250** -- fix(skill): deft-review-cycle -- strengthen batch-fix enforcement; add anti-pattern against per-finding fix commits (root cause of #247 multi-round review cycles)
- **#251** -- fix(skill): deft-build + deft-rwldl -- add semantic contradiction check when adding ! or ⊗ rules (search same file for conflicting ~ rules referencing same term before committing)

---

## Phase 2 -- Documentation & Content Fixes

Quick doc/content fixes that don't require code changes.

### Philosophy & Positioning

- **#89** -- Deft identity and positioning: resolve naming before README reframe (blocks #84 Phase 2 README reframe, `meta/philosophy.md`, interview strategy updates)

### Content & Doc Fixes

- **#151** -- [Playtest Feedback] First-time non-technical user session report (19 issues + 4 strategic recommendations) -- umbrella issue; content/wording fixes here, strategic recommendations (cost interview, co-pilot, tiered UX, IP risk flagging) deferred to Phase 5 (xrefs #77, #84, #89, #136)
- **#51** -- Project should be fully bootstrapped with its own framework (partially done in PR #66)
- Rename: purge remaining "Warping" references from README.md, `warping.sh`, Taskfile.yml; reframe README per #89 resolution (#84 Phase 2, blocked on #89)
  - `README.md` still says "Warping Process", "What is Warping?", "Contributing to Warping"
  - Reframe from "coding standards framework" → resolved tagline from #89
  - `Taskfile.yml` `VERSION` -- update to match latest release
  - `warping.sh` still present -- remove or deprecate (replaced by `run` in v0.5.0)
  - Verify: `test_standards.py` xfail for Warping references should flip to passing
- Clean leaked personal files:
  - ~~`core/project.md` -- Voxio Bot private project config~~ -- done (v0.10.0, t2.1.6: replaced with generic template + legacy redirect)
  - `PROJECT.md` (repo root) -- leftover from bootstrap test run; remove or replace
  - Verify: `test_standards.py` xfail for Voxio Bot content should flip to passing
- Update `strategies/interview.md` to probe language/tool choices through the contract lens -- when user picks a language, prompt to consider habit vs. suitability (#84 Phase 2)
- Create `meta/philosophy.md` -- full contract hierarchy narrative for agent reference and direct user reading (#84 Phase 2)
- **#82** -- Replacement strategies need accept-or-scrap exit when plan artifacts already exist (design: artifact awareness for chaining gate)
- **#103** -- Standalone brownfield/map analysis without requiring interview (allow `/deft:run:map` as independent entry point)
- **#127** -- Improved support for Deft in existing repositories -- bootstrap should detect existing code and offer brownfield/map analysis path instead of greenfield-only questionnaire (related to #103; CLI integration in Phase 4 with #53)
- Add missing strategies:
  - `strategies/rapid.md` -- Quick prototypes, SPECIFICATION only workflow
  - `strategies/enterprise.md` -- Compliance-heavy, PRD → ADR → SPECIFICATION workflow
  - Both listed in `strategies/README.md` as "(future)" with no backing file
- Port any remaining `SKILL.md` carry-forward content from master
  - Three commits on master updated SKILL.md (`a6f120a`, `cc442fc`, `2f2a89e`)
  - Largely superseded by `deft-setup`/`deft-build` skills; review for carry-forward content
- ~~Write remaining CHANGELOG entries~~ -- tracked by #71 (Phase 1)
- **#112** -- External “Deft Directive” PDF is premature -- describes post-Phase-1-3 state; defer distribution or add known-issues caveat; incorporate as `docs/getting-started.md` after Phases 1–3 ship
- **#114** -- Document all global Warp rules used for deft development; migrate project-scope rules to `AGENTS.md`/`CONVENTIONS.md`; inventory remaining global-only rules in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- **#136** -- Warp doesn't load deft's AGENTS.md by default -- document global rule workaround in README/installer output; real fix is Warp platform feature request (to be done with #114)
- **#194** -- User-facing best practices guide (`docs/best-practices.md`) -- Directive contract hierarchy usage, Warp swarming patterns, and user-oriented skill documentation; in-repo successor to premature PDF guide (#112); depends on #147 and #188 for stable content (xrefs #112, #84, #114)
- **#221** -- deft-roadmap-refresh skill: add explicit row format template (`| #NNN | title | Phase |`) and anti-pattern to Phase 2 Step 4 to prevent recurring double-pipe `||` index entries
- **#226** -- refactor: rename `deft-rwldl` skill to remove acronym collision with Wiggum quality loop; add auto-suggestion trigger to AGENTS.md Development Process section
- **#234** -- docs: README should document where user artifacts are stored in a consumer project (`./vbrief/`, `SPECIFICATION.md`, `PROJECT.md`, `USER.md`, `./deft/`)

---

## Phase 3 -- Test Infrastructure & CI

- **#74** -- Automate release process (`task release`) and CI changelog enforcement
- **#128** -- CI vBRIEF schema sync check: fetch upstream `vbrief-core.schema.json` from `deftai/vBRIEF`, diff against vendored copy, fail on divergence (depends on #57)
- **#115** -- Strengthen spec validation gate: add CI freshness check detecting stale `SPECIFICATION.md` (schema checks landed in PR #130 -- `spec_validate.py` now enforces vBRIEF v0.5 structure, status enum, legacy key detection)
- **#33** -- When using Docker, smoke tests and e2e tests should validate Docker (docker:up, /healthz)
- CLI tests for remaining commands: `cmd_spec`, `cmd_install`, `cmd_reset`, `cmd_update`
- Error and edge case testing for core CLI commands
- **#163** -- Enforce USER.md gate in CLI path -- parity with agentic (skills) path
  - `cmd_spec` and `cmd_project` should check for USER.md at entry; if absent, warn and redirect to `run bootstrap`
  - Skills path already done (deft-build); this covers the CLI fallback path only
- **#235** -- feat(tasks): add task toolchain:check and task changelog:check as task check deps (split from #233; no dependency on tasks/ restructure)
- Code signing for installer binaries (Windows Authenticode, macOS Developer ID + notarisation)
- Low-end LLM compatibility testing
  - Validate installer and agent process (deft-setup, deft-build) on small/quantised models (e.g. Qwen3-9B)
  - Ensure strategies, interview flow, and spec generation still produce good results
  - Document minimum recommended model size in README or AGENTS.md
- Upgrade GitHub Actions to Node.js 24
  - `actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-go`, `actions/upload-artifact`, `actions/download-artifact`
  - Bump to versions that support Node.js 24 when available (v5+), or set `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24=true`

---

## Phase 4 -- Package Distribution & Install UX

Publish deft as NPM + PIP CLI packages for developer-audience install.
Complements the Go installer (which targets novice/bare-machine users).

- **#56** -- Reduce installation friction -- add shell one-liner, Homebrew, and platform package managers (absorbed #101: decide whether manual clone path stays or goes)
- **#53** -- deft-install should bootstrap the current directory by default
- **#75** -- Skill auto-discovery: make deft skills work in both user projects and deft development (symlinks/copies to `.agents/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, etc.)
- **#11** -- NPM + PIP CLI distribution (`npm i -g @deftai/directive`, `pipx install deft-cli`)

**Prerequisites:** Phase 2 complete (clean content), issue #4 resolved (project-local layout)

Scope: `deft install`, `deft bootstrap`, `deft update`, `deft doctor` commands,
GitHub Actions publish workflows (tag → npm publish + twine upload),
README updated with NPM + PIP install paths alongside Go binary.

---

## Phase 5 -- CLI Overhaul & New Features

Larger feature work -- only after issues are resolved and content is stable.

- **#84 Phase 3** -- Deft as teacher: teach strategy, lessons evolution
  - Build `strategies/teach.md` -- Feynman technique applied to Deft itself, philosophy as a conversation
  - Evolve `lessons.md` -- when adding a lesson, include not just *what* was learned but *why it matters* in the contract hierarchy
- **#52** -- Install into `.deft/` (hidden directory) instead of `deft/`
- **#55** -- Register Deft commands as native agent slash commands (Claude Code, Copilot, Gemini, etc.) -- also absorbs slash-command registration scope from #54
- **#46** -- Provide a way for users to update meta MD files (SOUL, MORALS, CODE-FIELD, USER, etc.)
- **#77** -- Allow users to change technical rating (1/2/3) when starting a new project
- **#78** -- Bootstrap: offer to update user preferences when USER.md already exists
- **#86** -- Artifact-branch binding and complete audit trail for SDD (dual-format persistence, branch lifecycle hooks, artifact manifest)
- **#76** -- Obsidian Vault generation as structured agent memory (interlinked markdown notes, per-agent knowledge scopes)
- **#12** -- Deft Bootstrap CLI with TUI (Typer + Textual, strategy-aware feature branching, agent config generation)
- **#9** -- Issue tracking system integration (GitHub Issues, Jira, Asana -- optional, via MCP)
- **#95** -- Compliance-aligned constitution templates + readiness scanners (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, HiTrust); sub-issues #96–#100 cover config schema, control mapping registry, scoring, evidence gap analysis, and automation hooks
- **#140** -- Automatically check for updates to cloned repos in a project -- detect stale cloned dependencies, notify user; part of future `deft doctor`/`deft update` (new CLI tooling)
- **#160** -- Consider TypeScript instead of Python for `run` CLI -- architectural decision for CLI overhaul; decide before #11 and #12 (xrefs #118)
- **#212** -- discussion: Process control belongs in Directive -- universal process principles (review cycle, parallel work, batch-fix) as first-class Directive content; skills become tool-specific adapters; explicitly DO NOT IMPLEMENT until team decision reached (xrefs #89, #147, #194, #159)
- **#233** -- More Determinism: full initiative -- Phase 0 spec scaffolding (generated per-phase task gates), tasks/ directory restructure (monolithic Taskfile -> modular includes), task doctor, and remaining deterministic enforcement tasks (verify:stubs, build:verify, change:init, change:archive, validate:links, commit:lint); implementation layer for meta/philosophy.md #159; early-win subset split to #235 (Phase 3)
- LLM-assisted content validation
- Self-upgrade to Deft Directive product (branding, public docs, distribution packaging)
