"""release_e2e.py -- Auto-create + auto-destroy temp-repo release rehearsal (#716, #720).

Companion to ``scripts/release.py`` per the #716 safety hardening Q1
decision (auto-create + auto-destroy temp repo). ``task release:e2e``
provisions a private GitHub repo named
``deftai-release-test-<timestamp>-<uuid6>``, runs the full release
pipeline against it, then destroys the repo via ``gh repo delete --yes``
in a ``try/finally`` so cleanup runs even when the test fails.

Pipeline (#720 deepening) and env hygiene (#728 cycle 2)
--------------------------------------------------------
The rehearsal step was previously a smoke-test existence check
(``gh repo view``); per #720 it now mirrors the directive repo into
the temp remote and exercises the actual ``task release`` pipeline
end-to-end. Per the #728 cycle-2 Greptile review, every subprocess
that could resolve a project root (``clone_repo_to_temp``,
``dispatch_task_release``, ``dispatch_task_release_rollback``) must
also pin ``DEFT_PROJECT_ROOT=<clone_dir>`` so an operator with that
environment variable already exported in their shell does NOT have
``task release`` resolve back to the real directive repo and push
spurious ``v0.0.1`` artefacts to ``deftai/directive``.

1. Generate a unique repo slug (``deftai-release-test-<timestamp>-<uuid6>``)
2. ``gh repo create --private deftai/<slug> --description "..."``
3. Mirror the current directive repo into the temp remote and exercise
   the release pipeline:

   a. ``git clone <project_root> <tmpdir>`` -- shallow-style local clone
      (operates on the on-disk repo so we do not depend on network).
   b. ``git -C <tmpdir> remote set-url origin <temp-repo-url>`` -- point
      origin at the auto-created temp remote.
   c. ``git -C <tmpdir> push origin refs/heads/*:refs/heads/*
      refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*`` -- populate the temp remote with every
      branch and tag using explicit refspecs. We deliberately avoid
      ``git push --mirror`` here because ``--mirror`` also pushes
      ``refs/remotes/*`` (the local clone's remote-tracking refs);
      GitHub's receive-pack rejects writes to that namespace and the
      whole rehearsal would fail at the push step. Explicit refspecs
      cover the two namespaces we actually care about (heads + tags)
      without leaking remote-tracking refs.
   d. ``task release -- 0.0.1 --repo deftai/<slug> --skip-ci --skip-build``
      -- run the full 10-step pipeline against the temp repo. ``--skip-ci``
      and ``--skip-build`` (#720, see ``scripts/release.py``) keep the
      wall-clock manageable; CI / build semantics are covered by the
      unit-test suite at every commit on master.
   e. ``gh release view v0.0.1 --repo deftai/<slug>`` -- assert
      ``isDraft=true`` and ``tagName == v0.0.1`` (the production draft
      lifecycle, #716).
   f. ``git -C <tmpdir> ls-remote --tags origin v0.0.1`` -- assert the
      tag exists on the temp remote.
   g. ``task release:rollback -- 0.0.1 --repo deftai/<slug>`` -- exercise
      the rollback path against a known-state release (#725 forward-revert
      flow on a protected default branch).

4. ``gh repo delete deftai/<slug> --yes`` -- ALWAYS in a finally clause
5. If delete fails, surface a one-line manual cleanup hint and continue
   so the test result still reaches stdout

Wall-clock (#720)
-----------------
``--skip-ci`` and ``--skip-build`` keep the rehearsal wall-clock under
90 seconds on a typical operator machine. Skipping these is safe inside
the rehearsal because (a) CI runs at every commit on master via
``.github/workflows/ci.yml``; (b) build artefacts are not needed for
the draft-release verification step; (c) the unit-test suite covers
both paths in isolation.

Exit codes
----------
    0 -- rehearsal succeeded; cleanup succeeded (or surfaced as a warning)
    1 -- rehearsal failed; cleanup ran regardless
    2 -- config / argument error (gh missing, owner unset, ...)

Mockability
-----------
Every side-effecting step (``provision_temp_repo`` / ``destroy_temp_repo``
/ ``clone_repo_to_temp`` / ``set_origin_to_temp_repo`` / ``push_mirror``
/ ``dispatch_task_release`` / ``verify_draft_release`` / ``verify_tag``
/ ``dispatch_task_release_rollback``) is an isolated function so tests
can replace it with a mock; CI exercises the orchestration without
ever cloning, pushing, or hitting real GitHub.

    #728 cycle 2: ``env["DEFT_PROJECT_ROOT"] = str(clone_dir)`` is
    explicitly pinned BEFORE invoking ``task release``. The release CLI
    resolves its repository root via ``DEFT_PROJECT_ROOT`` (when set) ->
    ``--project-root`` -> the script's own parent. If the operator's
    shell already exported ``DEFT_PROJECT_ROOT`` (a common pattern
    when running deft itself out of a worktree), the rehearsal
    subprocess would resolve back to the REAL directive repo and the
    rest of the pipeline (CHANGELOG promotion, commit, tag, ``git push
    --atomic origin master v0.0.1``) would mutate ``deftai/directive``
    instead of the temp clone. Pinning the env var to ``clone_dir``
    eliminates that ambient-state hazard regardless of the operator's
    shell setup.

    the inverted-lookup vBRIEF-lifecycle-sync gate (#754) classifies
    every referenced issue number as NOT_FOUND -> Section (c) mismatch
    against an empty target. The gate has no meaningful signal in the
    rehearsal context, so the explicit-acknowledgment escape hatch is
    the correct surface to bypass it. The production cut path (against
    the real repo with real issues) does NOT pass this flag and remains
    fully gated. Without this flag, every ``task release:e2e`` invocation
    since #734 landed has failed at the inner Step 3 lifecycle gate.
