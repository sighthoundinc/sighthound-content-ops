# Yolo Strategy

Auto-pilot interview: the agent plays both sides, always picking the recommended
option. Same workflow as [interview.md](./interview.md) (including the sizing
gate) but the agent answers its own questions via "Johnbot."

Legend (from RFC2119): !=MUST, ~=SHOULD, ≉=SHOULD NOT, ⊗=MUST NOT, ?=MAY.

**⚠️ See also**: [strategies/interview.md](./interview.md) | [strategies/discuss.md](./discuss.md) | [core/glossary.md](../core/glossary.md)

---

## When to Use

- ~ Quick prototyping where speed matters more than precision
- ~ When the user trusts the agent's recommended defaults
- ? When exploring an idea before committing to a full interview
- ⊗ Production systems or compliance-heavy projects — use [interview.md](./interview.md) instead

## Chaining Gate

Johnbot auto-selects at the [chaining gate](./interview.md#chaining-gate) too.

- ! Johnbot MUST select **"Proceed to specification"** (option 1) — no preparatory detours
- ! Johnbot MUST select **"Accept"** at the [acceptance gate](./interview.md#acceptance-gate) — no revisions
- ⊗ Ask the real user to choose at either gate — Johnbot handles both automatically

## Sizing Gate

Johnbot picks the size too. The same sizing signals from
[interview.md](./interview.md#sizing-gate) apply, but Johnbot makes the call
without asking the user.

- ! Check `PROJECT.md` for `**Process**: Light` or `**Process**: Full` — if declared, use that path
- ! If not declared, Johnbot picks based on feature count and complexity signals
- ~ Default to Light for typical yolo projects (speed over ceremony)

## Interview Rules

Same as [interview.md](./interview.md#interview-rules-shared-by-both-paths),
with Johnbot additions:

- ~ Use Claude AskInterviewQuestion when available (emulate if not)
- ! Ask **ONE** focused, non-trivial question per step
- ⊗ Ask multiple questions at once or sneak in "also" questions
- ~ Provide numbered answer options when appropriate
- ! Include "other" option for custom/unknown responses
- ! Indicate which option is RECOMMENDED
- ! Pretend you are the user "Johnbot" too
- ~ Johnbot asks for details/clarifications on the questions when appropriate
- ! Johnbot ultimately goes with the RECOMMENDED option
- ⊗ Ask the real user to answer a question — keep working with Johnbot until you can build the specification

---

## Light Path (small/medium projects)

Interview → SPECIFICATION with embedded Requirements.
Same as [interview.md Light path](./interview.md#light-path-smallmedium-projects)
but Johnbot answers all questions.

### Flow

1. Johnbot picks Light at the sizing gate
2. Interview (Johnbot picks RECOMMENDED for each question)
3. Write `./vbrief/specification.vbrief.json` with `status: draft`
4. Auto-approve (update `status` to `approved`)
5. Run `task spec:render` (or generate `SPECIFICATION.md` directly if task unavailable)

- ! SPECIFICATION.md MUST include embedded Requirements section (FR-1, NFR-1)
- ! Each task SHOULD reference which FR/NFR it implements via `(traces: FR-N)`
- ⊗ Create a separate PRD.md on the Light path

---

## Full Path (large/complex projects)

Interview → PRD → SPECIFICATION with traceability.
Same as [interview.md Full path](./interview.md#full-path-largecomplex-projects)
but Johnbot answers all questions and auto-approves the PRD.

### Flow

1. Johnbot picks Full at the sizing gate
2. Interview (Johnbot picks RECOMMENDED for each question)
3. Generate `PRD.md` with structured requirements
4. Auto-approve PRD
5. Write `./vbrief/specification.vbrief.json` with `status: draft`
6. Auto-approve (update `status` to `approved`)
7. Run `task spec:render` (or generate `SPECIFICATION.md` directly if task unavailable)

- ! SPECIFICATION.md MUST trace tasks back to PRD requirement IDs (FR-1, NFR-1)

---

## SPECIFICATION Guidelines

Same as [interview.md](./interview.md#specification-guidelines-both-paths).

## Artifacts Summary

**Light path:**

| Artifact | Purpose | Created By |
|----------|---------|------------|
| `./vbrief/specification.vbrief.json` | Spec source of truth | Interview |
| `SPECIFICATION.md` | Generated plan with embedded Requirements | Rendered |

**Full path:**

| Artifact | Purpose | Created By |
|----------|---------|------------|
| `PRD.md` | What to build (auto-approved) | Interview |
| `./vbrief/specification.vbrief.json` | Spec source of truth | Post-PRD |
| `SPECIFICATION.md` | Generated implementation plan | Rendered |

## Invoking This Strategy

```
/deft:run:yolo [project name]
```

Or explicitly:

```
Use the yolo strategy to plan [project].
```

After completion:

```
implement SPECIFICATION.md
```
