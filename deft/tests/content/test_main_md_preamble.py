"""tests/content/test_main_md_preamble.py -- DEFT-PREAMBLE-V1 line-1 contract (#768).

Asserts the `<!-- DEFT-PREAMBLE-V1 -->` marker appears at line 1 of:
- `main.md`
- `SKILL.md`               (root)
- `skills/deft-setup/SKILL.md`   (legacy redirect stub)
- `skills/deft-build/SKILL.md`   (legacy redirect stub)

Together with the marker, the preamble body MUST instruct the agent to
run `python3 <run-path> gate` before any other instruction in the file.
The canonical `<run-path>` was flipped from `deft/run` to `.deft/core/run`
in v0.27 (#992 PR1) for `main.md` + `SKILL.md` (root); the two legacy
redirect-stub carriers (`skills/deft-setup/SKILL.md`,
`skills/deft-build/SKILL.md`) intentionally retain the pre-v0.27
`deft/run` form so v0.19 -> v0.20 stale-AGENTS.md references still resolve
through the `<!-- deft:deprecated-skill-redirect -->` contract (#411).

Story: #768 (universal-upgrade-gate); marker bump #992 PR1.
