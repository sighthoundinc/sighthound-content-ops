"""test_deprecated_skill_redirects.py -- Tests for #411 v0.19 -> v0.20 bridge
deprecation redirect stubs, UPGRADING.md, README upgrade banner, QUICK-START.md
upgrade detection, and template/setup.go agents-entry fallback rule.

Story: #411 (swarm-402)

These tests ensure that:
- The 8 legacy skills/deft-* paths that v0.19 AGENTS.md may reference each
  contain a small deprecation redirect stub pointing at deft/QUICK-START.md,
  so stale references never dead-end. "Accidental cleanup" (deleting what
  looks like an obsolete skill dir) will break these tests and surface the
  contract explicitly.
- UPGRADING.md exists at the repo root with a v0.20.0 section.
- README.md has a permanent upgrade banner.
- QUICK-START.md has the new upgrade-detection Step 2 and the session-restart
  instruction.
- templates/agents-entry.md (and its Go installer mirror) carry the fallback
  rule that sends agents to QUICK-START.md when a deft/skills/ path is
  unreadable.
