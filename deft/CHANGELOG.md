# Changelog

All notable changes to the Deft framework will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Agent Skill Auto-Discovery**: Added `.agents/skills/deft/`, `deft-setup/`, `deft-build/` thin pointer files to the repo — Warp and other agents now auto-discover deft skills on startup without user prompting (#94)
- **WriteAgentsSkills**: Installer now creates `.agents/skills/` in user project root during install so agents auto-discover deft skills immediately (#94)
- **Prescriptive Change Lifecycle Rule**: Added `! Before implementing any planned change that touches 3+ files or has an accepted plan artifact, propose /deft:change <name> and wait for confirmation` to `main.md` Decision Making section (#94)

### Changed
- **PrintNextSteps**: Installer output updated to reflect auto-discovery — no longer tells users to manually say 'read AGENTS.md and follow it' (#94)
- **AGENTS.md** (in-repo): Removed redundant Skills line — `.agents/skills/` handles discovery (#94)
- **agentsMDEntry**: Removed Skills line from install-generated AGENTS.md — `.agents/skills/` handles discovery, resolving the TODO from #75 (#94)

## [0.7.1] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **AGENTS.md Onboarding**: Install-generated `AGENTS.md` now contains self-contained bootstrap logic — first-session phase detection (USER.md → Phase 1, PROJECT.md → Phase 2, SPECIFICATION.md → Phase 3), returning-session guidance, and available commands reference (#54, closes #85)
- **Installer 'Next Steps' Output**: Removed false claim that agents read AGENTS.md automatically; users are now told to explicitly say `read AGENTS.md and follow it` with a note that auto-discovery is planned for a future release (#54, #85)
- **README Getting Started**: Removed false-automatic claims from Step 2 and manual clone path; added explicit agent kick-off instructions (#54, #85)
- **In-repo AGENTS.md**: Updated deft repo's own AGENTS.md with developer-focused content and correct root-relative paths (no `deft/` prefix) (#54)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Go Installer**: Cross-platform self-contained installer in `cmd/deft-install/` with 5 platform binaries, interactive setup wizard, and platform-aware git installation paths (#34, #35)

  - CLI custom rules prompt now collects actual rules line-by-line instead of accepting a single silent string
  - CLI meta-guidelines (SOUL.md, morals.md, code-field.md) now default to **included** with paragraph descriptions; users can drop any they don't want
  - `deft-setup` SKILL.md strategies table corrected: `interview`, `yolo`, `map`, `discuss`, `research`, `speckit`
  - `deft-setup` Track 1 now presents all three meta-guidelines as included by default with descriptions; user can drop any; Tracks 2/3 include all silently
  - `deft-setup` USER.md template now includes `## Experimental Rules` section when rules are selected

- **Trunk-Based Workflow**: Updated docs/workflow to remove stale beta-branch model and reflect short-lived feature branches (#69, #70)
- **Bootstrap Defaults**: `cmd_project` defaults project name from current directory and defaults "run spec now" to Yes (#47, #66)
- **Bootstrap Strategy Default**: Default strategy now uses `interview` instead of alphabetical first match (#66)
- **Tooling Dependency**: Bumped `black` from `26.3.0` to `26.3.1` (#48)
- **CHANGELOG Cleanup**: Backfilled post-0.6.0 entries, corrected release links to `deftai/directive`, and added missing `[Unreleased]` link reference (#71)

### Fixed
- **Double Prompting in Bootstrap Chain**: `cmd_project` now reads USER.md defaults (languages/strategy/coverage) instead of re-asking from scratch (#7, #43)
- **Ctrl+C Resume Protection**: Bootstrap/project flows now persist progress and support resume after interruption (#8, #66)
- **Input Validation Gaps**: Added validation for project type, language/strategy selections, coverage bounds, and duplicate selections (#44, #47, #66)
- **USER.md Overwrite Flow**: Added explicit keep/overwrite behavior when USER.md already exists (#44, #66)

### Changed

### Conflict Resolutions
- **CHANGELOG.md**: interleaved both sides chronologically (v0.5.1 → v0.2.3)
- **templates/make-spec.md**: kept beta's vBRIEF specification flow
- **templates/user.md.template**: kept beta's slim override-only template (v0.5.0 intentionally removed duplicated Workflow/AI Behavior sections)
