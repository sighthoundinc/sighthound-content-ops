"""Content tests for the deterministic-questions canonical contract (#767).

Scans skill prose for documented numbered menus and asserts:

1. ``contracts/deterministic-questions.md`` exists and documents the
   Discuss-pause semantic verbatim.
2. Each affected skill carries a ``!`` cross-reference pointing back to
   the contract (so individual skills don't duplicate the rule body, per
   the Rule Authority [AXIOM] block in main.md).
3. ``glossary.md`` carries a ``Deterministic mode`` entry pointing to
   the contract.

The file-level scope intentionally excludes:

- ``skills/deft-directive-interview/SKILL.md`` (Agent 2 owns this surface)
- ``skills/deft-directive-build/SKILL.md`` (Agent 3 owns this surface)

Both will land their cross-references in their own PRs.
